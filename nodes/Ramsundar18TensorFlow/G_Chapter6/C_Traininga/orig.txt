Figure 6-16. The CycleGAN is capable of performing complex image transformations,
such as transforming images of horses into those of zebras (and vice versa).

Unfortunately, generative adversarial networks are still challenging to train in prac‐
tice. Making generators and discriminators learn reasonable functions requires a
deep bag of tricks. As a result, while there have been many exciting GAN demonstra‐
tions, GANs have not yet matured into a state where they can be widely deployed in
industrial applications.

Training a Convolutional Network in TensorFlow
In this section we consider a code sample for training a simple convolutional neural
network. In particular, our code sample will demonstrate how to train a LeNet-5 con‐
volutional architecture on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. As always, we rec‐
ommend that you follow along by running the full code sample from the GitHub
repo associated with the book.

The MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of images of handwritten digits. The machine learning
challenge associated with MNIST consists of creating a model trained on the training
set of digits that generalizes to the validation set. Figure 6-17 shows some images
drawn from the MNIST dataset.
