Figure 6-8. A dilated (or atrous) convolution. Gaps are left in the local receptive field for
each neuron. Diagram (a) depicts a 1-dilated 3 × 3 convolution. Diagram (b) depicts the
application of a 2-dilated 3 × 3 convolution to (a). Diagram (c) depicts the application of
a 4-dilated 3 × 3 convolution to (b). Notice that the (a) layer has receptive field of width
3, the (b) layer has receptive field of width 7, and the (c) layer has receptive field of width
15.

Applications of Convolutional Networks
In the previous section, we covered the mechanics of convolutional networks and
introduced you to many of the components that make up these networks. In this sec‐
tion, we describe some applications that convolutional architectures enable.

Object Detection and Localization
Object detection is the task of detecting the objects (or entities) present in a photo‐
graph. Object localization is the task of identifying where in the image the objects
exist and drawing a “bounding box” around each occurrence. Figure 6-9 demon‐
strates what detection and localization on standard images looks like.
