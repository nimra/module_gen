# 
# 
# 
# 
# This book will introduce you to the fundamentals of machine learning through Ten‐
# sorFlow. TensorFlow is Google’s new software library for deep learning that makes it
# straightforward for engineers to design and deploy sophisticated deep learning archi‐
# tectures. You will learn how to use TensorFlow to build systems capable of detecting
# objects in images, understanding human text, and predicting the properties of poten‐
# tial medicines. Furthermore, you will gain an intuitive understanding of TensorFlow’s
# potential as a system for performing tensor calculus and will learn how to use Tensor‐
# Flow for tasks outside the traditional purview of machine learning.
# Importantly, TensorFlow for Deep Learning is one of the first deep learning books
# written for practitioners. It teaches fundamental concepts through practical examples
# and builds understanding of machine learning foundations from the ground up. The
# target audience for this book is practicing developers, who are comfortable with
# designing software systems, but not necessarily with creating learning systems. At
# times we use some basic linear algebra and calculus, but we will review all necessary
# fundamentals. We also anticipate that our book will prove useful for scientists and
# other professionals who are comfortable with scripting, but not necessarily with
# designing learning algorithms.
