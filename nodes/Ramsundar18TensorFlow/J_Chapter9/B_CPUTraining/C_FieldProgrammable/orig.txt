Field Programmable Gate Arrays
Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are a type of “field programmable” ASIC.
Standard FPGAs can often be reconfigured via hardware description languages such
as Verilog to implement new ASIC designs dynamically. While FPGAs are generally
less efficient than custom ASICs, they can offer significant speed improvements over
CPU implementations. Microsoft in particular has used FPGAs to perform deep
learning inference and claims to have achieved significant speedups with their
deployment. However, the approach has not yet caught on widely outside Microsoft.

Neuromorphic Chips
The “neurons” in deep networks mathematically model the 1940s understanding of
neuronal biology. Needless to say, biological understanding of neuronal behavior has
progressed dramatically since then. For one, it’s now known that the nonlinear activa‐
tions used in deep networks aren’t accurate models of neuronal nonlinearity. The
“spike trains” is a better model (see Figure 9-4), where neurons activate in short-lived
bursts (spikes) but fall to background most of the time.




Figure 9-4. Neurons often activate in short-lived bursts called spike trains (A). Neuro‐
morphic chips attempt to model spiking behavior in computing hardware. Biological
neurons are complex entities (B), so these models are still only approximate.

Hardware engineers have spent significant effort exploring whether it’s possible to
create chip designs based on spike trains rather than on existing circuit technologies
(CPUs, GPUs, ASICs). These designers argue that today’s chip designs suffer from
fundamental power limitations; the brain consumes many orders of magnitude less
