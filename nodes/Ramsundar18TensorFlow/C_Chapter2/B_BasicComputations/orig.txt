viewed as assigning individual entries of a multidimensional array, when provided
indices into the array as arguments.
We won’t use this more mathematical definition much in this book, but it serves as a
useful bridge to connect the deep learning concepts you will learn about with the cen‐
turies of mathematical research that have been undertaken on tensors by the physics
and mathematics communities.

               Covariance and Contravariance
               Our definition here has swept many details under the rug that
               would need to be carefully attended to for a formal treatment. For
               example, we don’t touch upon the notion of covariant and contra‐
               variant indices here. What we call a rank-n tensor is better
               described as a (p, q)-tensor where n = p + q and p is the number of
               contravariant indices, and q the number of covariant indices.
               Matrices are (1,1)-tensors, for example. As a subtlety, there are
               rank-2 tensors that are not matrices! We won’t dig into these topics
               carefully here since they don’t crop up much in machine learning,
               but we encourage you to understand how covariance and contra‐
               variance affect the machine learning systems you construct.


Basic Computations in TensorFlow
We’ve spent the last sections covering the mathematical definitions of various tensors.
It’s now time to cover how to create and manipulate tensors using TensorFlow. For
this section, we recommend you follow along using an interactive Python session
(with IPython). Many of the basic TensorFlow concepts are easiest to understand
after experimenting with them directly.

Installing TensorFlow and Getting Started
Before continuing this section, you will need to install TensorFlow on your machine.
The details of installation will vary depending on your particular hardware, so we
refer you to the official TensorFlow documentation for more details.
Although there are frontends to TensorFlow in multiple programming languages, we
will exclusively use the TensorFlow Python API in the remainder of this book. We
recommend that you install Anaconda Python, which packages many useful numeri‐
cal libraries along with the base Python executable.
Once you’ve installed TensorFlow, we recommend that you invoke it interactively
while you’re learning the basic API (see Example 2-1). When experimenting with
TensorFlow interactively, it’s convenient to use tf.InteractiveSession(). Invoking
this statement within IPython (an interactive Python shell) will make TensorFlow
