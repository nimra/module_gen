robotic manipulation tasks. Google has demonstrated that reinforcement learning
can be deployed to learn robotic object control, using a factory of robotic arms to
enable large-scale training on real robots (see Figure 10-1). It’s likely that such
enhanced learning techniques for robots will begin filtering into the larger robotics
industry over the next few years.




Figure 10-1. Google maintains a number of robotic arms that it uses to test deep rein‐
forcement learning methods for robotic control. This fundamental research will likely
find its way to the factory floor in the next few years.

Deep Learning in Agriculture
Industrial farming is already heavily mechanized, with sophisticated tractors
deployed to plant and even pick crops. Advances in robotics and in computer vision
are accelerating this trend toward automation. Convolutional networks have already
been employed to identify weeds for removal with less pesticide. Other companies
have experimented with self-driving tractors, automated fruit picking, and algorith‐
mic crop yield optimization. These are mainly research projects for the time being,
but these efforts will likely blossom into major deployments over the next decade.

Using Deep Learning Ethically
Most of this book has focused on the effective use of deep learning. We’ve covered
many techniques for building deep models that generalize well on different data
types. However, it’s also worth spending spending some time thinking about the soci‐
etal effects of the systems we build as engineers. Deep learning systems unleash a host
of potentially unsettling applications.
