                                                                       Preface




This book will introduce you to the fundamentals of machine learning through Ten‐
sorFlow. TensorFlow is Google’s new software library for deep learning that makes it
straightforward for engineers to design and deploy sophisticated deep learning archi‐
tectures. You will learn how to use TensorFlow to build systems capable of detecting
objects in images, understanding human text, and predicting the properties of poten‐
tial medicines. Furthermore, you will gain an intuitive understanding of TensorFlow’s
potential as a system for performing tensor calculus and will learn how to use Tensor‐
Flow for tasks outside the traditional purview of machine learning.
Importantly, TensorFlow for Deep Learning is one of the first deep learning books
written for practitioners. It teaches fundamental concepts through practical examples
and builds understanding of machine learning foundations from the ground up. The
target audience for this book is practicing developers, who are comfortable with
designing software systems, but not necessarily with creating learning systems. At
times we use some basic linear algebra and calculus, but we will review all necessary
fundamentals. We also anticipate that our book will prove useful for scientists and
other professionals who are comfortable with scripting, but not necessarily with
designing learning algorithms.
