Figure 8-6. The decision boundary may not always be simpler with lower dimensions

PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is by far the most popular dimensionality reduc‐
tion algorithm. First it identifies the hyperplane that lies closest to the data, and then
it projects the data onto it.

Preserving the Variance
Before you can project the training set onto a lower-dimensional hyperplane, you
first need to choose the right hyperplane. For example, a simple 2D dataset is repre‐
sented on the left of Figure 8-7, along with three different axes (i.e., one-dimensional
hyperplanes). On the right is the result of the projection of the dataset onto each of
these axes. As you can see, the projection onto the solid line preserves the maximum
variance, while the projection onto the dotted line preserves very little variance, and
the projection onto the dashed line preserves an intermediate amount of variance.
