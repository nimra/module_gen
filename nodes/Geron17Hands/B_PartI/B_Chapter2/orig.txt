                End-to-End Machine Learning Project




In this chapter, you will go through an example project end to end, pretending to be a
recently hired data scientist in a real estate company.1 Here are the main steps you will
go through:

 1. Look at the big picture.
 2. Get the data.
 3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
 4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
 5. Select a model and train it.
 6. Fine-tune your model.
 7. Present your solution.
 8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.


Working with Real Data
When you are learning about Machine Learning it is best to actually experiment with
real-world data, not just artificial datasets. Fortunately, there are thousands of open
datasets to choose from, ranging across all sorts of domains. Here are a few places
you can look to get data:

  â€¢ Popular open data repositories:


1 The example project is completely fictitious; the goal is just to illustrate the main steps of a Machine Learning
  project, not to learn anything about the real estate business.
