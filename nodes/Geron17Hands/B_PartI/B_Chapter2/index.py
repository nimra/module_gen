#                 End-to-End Machine Learning Project
# 
# 
# 
# 
# In this chapter, you will go through an example project end to end, pretending to be a
# recently hired data scientist in a real estate company.1 Here are the main steps you will
# go through:
# 
#  1. Look at the big picture.
#  2. Get the data.
#  3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
#  4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
#  5. Select a model and train it.
#  6. Fine-tune your model.
#  7. Present your solution.
#  8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
#

# Working with Real Data
# When you are learning about Machine Learning it is best to actually experiment with
# real-world data, not just artificial datasets. Fortunately, there are thousands of open
# datasets to choose from, ranging across all sorts of domains. Here are a few places
# you can look to get data:
# 
#   â€¢ Popular open data repositories:
# 
# 
# 1 The example project is completely fictitious; the goal is just to illustrate the main steps of a Machine Learning
#   project, not to learn anything about the real estate business.
