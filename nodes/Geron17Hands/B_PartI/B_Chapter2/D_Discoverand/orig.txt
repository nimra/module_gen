Now you should remove the income_cat attribute so the data is back to its original
state:
    for set in (strat_train_set, strat_test_set):
        set.drop(["income_cat"], axis=1, inplace=True)
We spent quite a bit of time on test set generation for a good reason: this is an often
neglected but critical part of a Machine Learning project. Moreover, many of these
ideas will be useful later when we discuss cross-validation. Now it’s time to move on
to the next stage: exploring the data.

Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights
So far you have only taken a quick glance at the data to get a general understanding of
the kind of data you are manipulating. Now the goal is to go a little bit more in depth.
First, make sure you have put the test set aside and you are only exploring the train‐
ing set. Also, if the training set is very large, you may want to sample an exploration
set, to make manipulations easy and fast. In our case, the set is quite small so you can
just work directly on the full set. Let’s create a copy so you can play with it without
harming the training set:
    housing = strat_train_set.copy()


Visualizing Geographical Data
Since there is geographical information (latitude and longitude), it is a good idea to
create a scatterplot of all districts to visualize the data (Figure 2-11):
    housing.plot(kind="scatter", x="longitude", y="latitude")
