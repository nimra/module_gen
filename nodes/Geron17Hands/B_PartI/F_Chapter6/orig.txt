                                                          Decision Trees




Like SVMs, Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can per‐
form both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks. They are
very powerful algorithms, capable of fitting complex datasets. For example, in Chap‐
ter 2 you trained a DecisionTreeRegressor model on the California housing dataset,
fitting it perfectly (actually overfitting it).
Decision Trees are also the fundamental components of Random Forests (see Chap‐
ter 7), which are among the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available
today.
In this chapter we will start by discussing how to train, visualize, and make predic‐
tions with Decision Trees. Then we will go through the CART training algorithm
used by Scikit-Learn, and we will discuss how to regularize trees and use them for
regression tasks. Finally, we will discuss some of the limitations of Decision Trees.

Training and Visualizing a Decision Tree
To understand Decision Trees, let’s just build one and take a look at how it makes pre‐
dictions. The following code trains a DecisionTreeClassifier on the iris dataset
(see Chapter 4):
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

    iris = load_iris()
    X = iris.data[:, 2:] # petal length and width
    y = iris.target

    tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)
    tree_clf.fit(X, y)



                                                                                    167
