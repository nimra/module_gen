                                                                            Classification




In Chapter 1 we mentioned that the most common supervised learning tasks are
regression (predicting values) and classification (predicting classes). In Chapter 2 we
explored a regression task, predicting housing values, using various algorithms such
as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests (which will be explained
in further detail in later chapters). Now we will turn our attention to classification
systems.

MNIST
In this chapter, we will be using the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small
images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Cen‐
sus Bureau. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents. This set has been stud‐
ied so much that it is often called the “Hello World” of Machine Learning: whenever
people come up with a new classification algorithm, they are curious to see how it
will perform on MNIST. Whenever someone learns Machine Learning, sooner or
later they tackle MNIST.
Scikit-Learn provides many helper functions to download popular datasets. MNIST is
one of them. The following code fetches the MNIST dataset:1
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_mldata
    >>> mnist = fetch_mldata('MNIST original')
    >>> mnist
    {'COL_NAMES': ['label', 'data'],
     'DESCR': 'mldata.org dataset: mnist-original',
     'data': array([[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0],



1 By default Scikit-Learn caches downloaded datasets in a directory called $HOME/scikit_learn_data.
