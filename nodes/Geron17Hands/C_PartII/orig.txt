                   Up and Running with TensorFlow




TensorFlow is a powerful open source software library for numerical computation,
particularly well suited and fine-tuned for large-scale Machine Learning. Its basic
principle is simple: you first define in Python a graph of computations to perform
(for example, the one in Figure 9-1), and then TensorFlow takes that graph and runs
it efficiently using optimized C++ code.

Most importantly, it is possible to break up the graph into several chunks and run
them in parallel across multiple CPUs or GPUs (as shown in Figure 9-2). TensorFlow
also supports distributed computing, so you can train colossal neural networks on
humongous training sets in a reasonable amount of time by splitting the computa‚Äê
tions across hundreds of servers (see Chapter 12). TensorFlow can train a network
with millions of parameters on a training set composed of billions of instances with
millions of features each. This should come as no surprise, since TensorFlow was
