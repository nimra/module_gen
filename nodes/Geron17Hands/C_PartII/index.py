#                    Up and Running with TensorFlow
# 
# 
# 
# 
# TensorFlow is a powerful open source software library for numerical computation,
# particularly well suited and fine-tuned for large-scale Machine Learning. Its basic
# principle is simple: you first define in Python a graph of computations to perform
# (for example, the one in Figure 9-1), and then TensorFlow takes that graph and runs
# it efficiently using optimized C++ code.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Figure 9-1. A simple computation graph
# 
# Most importantly, it is possible to break up the graph into several chunks and run
# them in parallel across multiple CPUs or GPUs (as shown in Figure 9-2). TensorFlow
# also supports distributed computing, so you can train colossal neural networks on
# humongous training sets in a reasonable amount of time by splitting the computa‚Äê
# tions across hundreds of servers (see Chapter 12). TensorFlow can train a network
# with millions of parameters on a training set composed of billions of instances with
# millions of features each. This should come as no surprise, since TensorFlow was
