Installation
Letâ€™s get started! Assuming you installed Jupyter and Scikit-Learn by following the
installation instructions in Chapter 2, you can simply use pip to install TensorFlow. If
you created an isolated environment using virtualenv, you first need to activate it:
      $ cd $ML_PATH                           # Your ML working directory (e.g., $HOME/ml)
      $ source env/bin/activate
Next, install TensorFlow:
      $ pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow


                      For GPU support, you need to install tensorflow-gpu instead of
                      tensorflow. See Chapter 12 for more details.




To test your installation, type the following command. It should output the version of
TensorFlow you installed.
      $ python3 -c 'import tensorflow; print(tensorflow.__version__)'
      1.0.0


Creating Your First Graph and Running It in a Session
The following code creates the graph represented in Figure 9-1:
      import tensorflow as tf

      x = tf.Variable(3, name="x")
      y = tf.Variable(4, name="y")
      f = x*x*y + y + 2
