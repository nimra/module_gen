The Machine Learning Tsunami
In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton et al. published a paper1 showing how to train a deep neural
network capable of recognizing handwritten digits with state-of-the-art precision
(>98%). They branded this technique “Deep Learning.” Training a deep neural net
was widely considered impossible at the time,2 and most researchers had abandoned
the idea since the 1990s. This paper revived the interest of the scientific community
and before long many new papers demonstrated that Deep Learning was not only
possible, but capable of mind-blowing achievements that no other Machine Learning
(ML) technique could hope to match (with the help of tremendous computing power
and great amounts of data). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of
Machine Learning.
Fast-forward 10 years and Machine Learning has conquered the industry: it is now at
the heart of much of the magic in today’s high-tech products, ranking your web
search results, powering your smartphone’s speech recognition, and recommending
videos, beating the world champion at the game of Go. Before you know it, it will be
driving your car.

Machine Learning in Your Projects
So naturally you are excited about Machine Learning and you would love to join the
party!
Perhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own? Make it rec‐
ognize faces? Or learn to walk around?

  since the 1990s, although they were not as general purpose.
