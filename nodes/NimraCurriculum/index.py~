# Introduction
# Machine learning and deep learning technologies have impacted the world in profound
# ways, from how we interact with technological products and with one another. These
# technologies are disrupting how we relate, how we work, and how we engage life in
# general. Today, and in the foreseeable future, intelligent machines increasingly form
# the core upon which sociocultural and socioeconomic relationships rest. We are indeed
# already in the "age of intelligence."
# 
# 
# 
# What Are Machine Learning and Deep Learning?
# Machine learning can be described as an assortment of tools and techniques for
# predicting or classifying a future event based on a set of interactions between variables
# (also referred to as features or attributes) in a particular dataset. Deep learning, on the
# other hand, extends a machine learning algorithm called neural network for learning
# complex tasks which are incredibly difficult for a computer to perform. Examples of
# these tasks may include recognizing faces and understanding languages in their varied
# contextual meanings.
# 
# 
# 
# The Role of Big Data
# A key ingredient that is critical to the rise and future improved performance of
# machine learning and deep learning is data. Since the turn of the twenty-first century,
# there has been a steady exponential increase in the amount of data generated and
# stored. The rise of humongous data is partly due to the emergence of the Internet and
# the miniaturization of processors that have spurned the "Internet of Things (IoT)"
# technologies. These vast amounts of data have made it possible to train the computer to
# learn complex tasks where an explicit instruction set is infeasible.
