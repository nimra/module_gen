# Support Vector Machines
# Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm for learning classification
# and regression models. To build intuition, we will consider the case of learning a
# classification model with SVM. Given a dataset with two target classes that are linearly
# separable, it turns out that there exists an infinite number of lines that can discriminate
# between the two classes (see Figure 22-1). The goal of the SVM is to find the best line that
# separates the two classes. In higher dimensions, this line is called a hyperplane.

# What Is a Hyperplane?
# A hyperplane is a line or more technically called a discriminant that separates two
# classes in n-dimensional space. When a hyperplane is drawn in 2-D space, it is called a
# line. In 3-D space, it is called a plane, and in dimensions greater than 3, the discriminant
# is called a hyperplane (see Figure 22-2). For any n-dimensional world, we have n-1
# hyperplanes.
