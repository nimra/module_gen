# CHAPTER 9
# 
# 
# 
# Python
# Python is one of the preferred languages for data science in the industry primarily
# because of its simple syntax and the number of reusable machine learning/deep
# learning packages. These packages make it easy to develop data science products
# without getting bogged down with the internals of a particular algorithm or method.
# They have been written, debugged, and tested by the best experts in the field, as well as
# by a large supporting community of developers that contribute their time and expertise
# to maintain and improve them.
#     In this section, we will go through the foundations of programming with Python 3.
# This section forms a framework for working with higher-level packages such as NumPy,
# Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras. The programming paradigm we will cover
# in this chapter can be easily adapted or applied to similar languages, such as R, which is
# also commonly used in the data science industry.
#     The best way to work through this chapter and the successive chapters in this part is to
# work through the code by executing them on Google Colab or GCP Deep Learning VMs.

#  ata and Operations
# Fundamentally, programming involves storing data and operating on that data to
# generate information. Techniques for efficient data storage are studied in the field called
# data structures, while the techniques for operating on data are studied as algorithms.
#     Data is stored in a memory block on the computer. Think of a memory block as a
# container holding data (Figure 9-1). When data is operated upon, the newly processed
# data is also stored in memory. Data is operated by using arithmetic and boolean
# expressions and functions.

# Figure 9-1. An illustration of a memory cell holding data
# 
#      In programming, a memory location is called a variable. A variable is a container
# for storing the data that is assigned to it. A variable is usually given a unique name by
# the programmer to represent a particular memory cell. In python, variable names are
# programmer defined, but it must follow a valid naming condition of only alphanumeric
# lowercase characters with words separated by an underscore. Also, a variable name
# should have semantic meaning to the data that is stored in that variable. This helps to
# improve code readability later in the future.
#      The act of placing data to a variable is called assignment.
# 
# # assigning data to a variable
# x = 1
# user_name = 'Emmanuel Okoi'
# 
# 
# 
# Data Types
# Python has the number and string data types in addition to other supported specialized
# datatypes. The number datatype, for instance, can be an int or a float. Strings are
# surrounded by quotes in Python.
# 
# # data types
# type(3)
# 'Output': int
# type(3.0)
# 'Output': float
