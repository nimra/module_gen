# TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras
# TensorFlow (TF) is a specialized numerical computation library for deep learning. It is
# the preferred tool by numerous deep learning researchers and industry practitioners for
# developing deep learning models and architectures as well as for serving learned models
# into production servers and software products. This chapter is focused on TensorFlow 2.0.
# 
# 
# 
# Navigating Through the TensorFlow API
# Understanding the different levels of the TF API hierarchy is critical to working
# effectively with TF. The task of building a TF deep learning model may be addressed
# via different TF API levels. An understanding of the API hierarchy provides clarity on
# implementing neural network models with TF as well as navigating the TF ecosystem.
# The TF API hierarchy is primarily composed of three API levels, the high-level API, the
# mid-level API which provides components for building neural network models, and the
# low-level API. A diagrammatic representation of this is shown in Figure 30-1.

# 
# The Low-Level TensorFlow APIs
# The low-level API gives the tools for building network graphs from the ground up using
# mathematical operations. This API level affords the greatest level of flexibility to tweak
# and tune the model as desired. Moreover, the higher-level APIs implement low-level
# operations under the hood.
# 
# 
# The Mid-Level TensorFlow APIs
# TensorFlow provides a set of reusable packages for simplifying the process involved in
# creating neural network models. Some examples of these functions include the layers
# (tf.keras.layers), Datasets (tf.data), metrics (tf.keras.metrics), loss (tf.keras.losses),
# and FeatureColumns (tf.feature_column) packages.
# 
# L ayers
# The layers package (tf.keras.layers) provides a handy set of functions to simplify the
# construction of layers in a neural network architecture. For example, consider the
# convolutional network architecture in Figure 30-2 and how the layers API simplifies the
# creation of the network layers.
