explore aggregations in Pandas, from simple operations akin to what we’ve seen on
NumPy arrays, to more sophisticated operations based on the concept of a groupby.

Planets Data
Here we will use the Planets dataset, available via the Seaborn package (see “Visuali‐
zation with Seaborn” on page 311). It gives information on planets that astronomers
have discovered around other stars (known as extrasolar planets or exoplanets for
short). It can be downloaded with a simple Seaborn command:
    In[2]: import seaborn as sns
           planets = sns.load_dataset('planets')
           planets.shape
    Out[2]: (1035, 6)
    In[3]: planets.head()
    Out[3]:       method              number   orbital_period   mass  distance      year
              0   Radial   Velocity   1        269.300          7.10  77.40         2006
              1   Radial   Velocity   1        874.774          2.21  56.95         2008
              2   Radial   Velocity   1        763.000          2.60  19.84         2011
              3   Radial   Velocity   1        326.030          19.40 110.62        2007
              4   Radial   Velocity   1        516.220          10.50 119.47        2009
This has some details on the 1,000+ exoplanets discovered up to 2014.

Simple Aggregation in Pandas
Earlier we explored some of the data aggregations available for NumPy arrays
(“Aggregations: Min, Max, and Everything in Between” on page 58). As with a one-
dimensional NumPy array, for a Pandas Series the aggregates return a single value:
    In[4]: rng = np.random.RandomState(42)
           ser = pd.Series(rng.rand(5))
           ser
    Out[4]: 0    0.374540
            1    0.950714
            2    0.731994
            3    0.598658
            4    0.156019
            dtype: float64
    In[5]: ser.sum()
    Out[5]: 2.8119254917081569
    In[6]: ser.mean()
    Out[6]: 0.56238509834163142

For a DataFrame, by default the aggregates return results within each column:



                                                                  Aggregation and Grouping   |   159
