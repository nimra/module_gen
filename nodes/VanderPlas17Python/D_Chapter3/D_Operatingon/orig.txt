Operating on Data in Pandas
One of the essential pieces of NumPy is the ability to perform quick element-wise
operations, both with basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) and
with more sophisticated operations (trigonometric functions, exponential and loga‐
rithmic functions, etc.). Pandas inherits much of this functionality from NumPy, and
the ufuncs that we introduced in “Computation on NumPy Arrays: Universal Func‐
tions” on page 50 are key to this.
Pandas includes a couple useful twists, however: for unary operations like negation
and trigonometric functions, these ufuncs will preserve index and column labels in the
output, and for binary operations such as addition and multiplication, Pandas will
automatically align indices when passing the objects to the ufunc. This means that
keeping the context of data and combining data from different sources—both poten‐
tially error-prone tasks with raw NumPy arrays—become essentially foolproof ones
with Pandas. We will additionally see that there are well-defined operations between
one-dimensional Series structures and two-dimensional DataFrame structures.

Ufuncs: Index Preservation
Because Pandas is designed to work with NumPy, any NumPy ufunc will work on
Pandas Series and DataFrame objects. Let’s start by defining a simple Series and
DataFrame on which to demonstrate this:
    In[1]: import pandas as pd
           import numpy as np
    In[2]: rng = np.random.RandomState(42)
           ser = pd.Series(rng.randint(0, 10, 4))
           ser
    Out[2]: 0    6
            1    3
            2    7
            3    4
            dtype: int64
    In[3]: df = pd.DataFrame(rng.randint(0, 10, (3, 4)),
                             columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
           df
    Out[3]:       A   B   C   D
              0   6   9   2   6
              1   7   4   3   7
              2   7   2   5   4
If we apply a NumPy ufunc on either of these objects, the result will be another Pan‐
das object with the indices preserved:
    In[4]: np.exp(ser)
