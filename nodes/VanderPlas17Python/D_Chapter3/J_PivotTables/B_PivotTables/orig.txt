Pivot Tables by Hand
To start learning more about this data, we might begin by grouping it according to
gender, survival status, or some combination thereof. If you have read the previous
section, you might be tempted to apply a GroupBy operation—for example, let’s look
at survival rate by gender:
    In[3]: titanic.groupby('sex')[['survived']].mean()
    Out[3]:            survived
              sex
              female    0.742038
              male      0.188908
This immediately gives us some insight: overall, three of every four females on board
survived, while only one in five males survived!
This is useful, but we might like to go one step deeper and look at survival by both sex
and, say, class. Using the vocabulary of GroupBy, we might proceed using something
like this: we group by class and gender, select survival, apply a mean aggregate, com‐
bine the resulting groups, and then unstack the hierarchical index to reveal the hidden
multidimensionality. In code:
    In[4]: titanic.groupby(['sex', 'class'])['survived'].aggregate('mean').unstack()
    Out[4]: class          First   Second    Third
            sex
            female      0.968085 0.921053 0.500000
            male        0.368852 0.157407 0.135447
This gives us a better idea of how both gender and class affected survival, but the
code is starting to look a bit garbled. While each step of this pipeline makes sense in
light of the tools we’ve previously discussed, the long string of code is not particularly
easy to read or use. This two-dimensional GroupBy is common enough that Pandas
includes a convenience routine, pivot_table, which succinctly handles this type of
multidimensional aggregation.

Pivot Table Syntax
Here is the equivalent to the preceding operation using the pivot_table method of
DataFrames:
    In[5]: titanic.pivot_table('survived', index='sex', columns='class')
    Out[5]: class         First    Second    Third
            sex
            female     0.968085 0.921053 0.500000
            male       0.368852 0.157407 0.135447

This is eminently more readable than the GroupBy approach, and produces the same
result. As you might expect of an early 20th-century transatlantic cruise, the survival


                                                                         Pivot Tables   |   171
