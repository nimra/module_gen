Locator class             Description
LinearLocator             Evenly spaced ticks from min to max
LogLocator                Logarithmically ticks from min to max
MultipleLocator           Ticks and range are a multiple of base
MaxNLocator               Finds up to a max number of ticks at nice locations

Customizing Matplotlib: Configurations and Stylesheets
Matplotlib’s default plot settings are often the subject of complaint among its users.
While much is slated to change in the 2.0 Matplotlib release, the ability to customize
default settings helps bring the package in line with your own aesthetic preferences.
Here we’ll walk through some of Matplotlib’s runtime configuration (rc) options, and
take a look at the newer stylesheets feature, which contains some nice sets of default
configurations.

Plot Customization by Hand
Throughout this chapter, we’ve seen how it is possible to tweak individual plot set‐
tings to end up with something that looks a little bit nicer than the default. It’s possi‐
ble to do these customizations for each individual plot. For example, here is a fairly
drab default histogram (Figure 4-81):
      In[1]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
             plt.style.use('classic')
             import numpy as np

                %matplotlib inline
