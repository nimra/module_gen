We can use a rounded box (fancybox) or add a shadow, change the transparency
(alpha value) of the frame, or change the padding around the text (Figure 4-44):
    In[6]: ax.legend(fancybox=True, framealpha=1, shadow=True, borderpad=1)
           fig

Choosing Elements for the Legend
As we’ve already seen, the legend includes all labeled elements by default. If this is not
what is desired, we can fine-tune which elements and labels appear in the legend by
using the objects returned by plot commands. The plt.plot() command is able to
create multiple lines at once, and returns a list of created line instances. Passing any of
these to plt.legend() will tell it which to identify, along with the labels we’d like to
specify (Figure 4-45):
    In[7]: y = np.sin(x[:, np.newaxis] + np.pi * np.arange(0, 2, 0.5))
           lines = plt.plot(x, y)

               plt.legend(lines[:2], ['first', 'second']);




Figure 4-45. Customization of legend elements

I generally find in practice that it is clearer to use the first method, applying labels to
the plot elements you’d like to show on the legend (Figure 4-46):
      In[8]: plt.plot(x, y[:, 0], label='first')
             plt.plot(x, y[:, 1], label='second')
             plt.plot(x, y[:, 2:])
             plt.legend(framealpha=1, frameon=True);

Notice that by default, the legend ignores all elements without a label attribute set.

Legend for Size of Points
Sometimes the legend defaults are not sufficient for the given visualization. For exam‐
ple, perhaps you’re using the size of points to mark certain features of the data, and
want to create a legend reflecting this. Here is an example where we’ll use the size of
points to indicate populations of California cities. We’d like a legend that specifies the
