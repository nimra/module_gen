      TensorFlow have recently made deep learning approaches much more accessible
      than they once were. As of the writing of this book, deep learning in Python is
      still relatively young, and so I can’t yet point to any definitive resource. That said,
      the list of references in the following section should provide a useful place to
      start.

Further Machine Learning Resources
This chapter has been a quick tour of machine learning in Python, primarily using
the tools within the Scikit-Learn library. As long as the chapter is, it is still too short
to cover many interesting and important algorithms, approaches, and discussions.
Here I want to suggest some resources for those who would like to learn more about
machine learning.

Machine Learning in Python
To learn more about machine learning in Python, I’d suggest some of the following
resources:
The Scikit-Learn website
    The Scikit-Learn website has an impressive breadth of documentation and exam‐
    ples covering some of the models discussed here, and much, much more. If you
    want a brief survey of the most important and often used machine learning algo‐
    rithms, this website is a good place to start.
SciPy, PyCon, and PyData tutorial videos
    Scikit-Learn and other machine learning topics are perennial favorites in the
    tutorial tracks of many Python-focused conference series, in particular the
    PyCon, SciPy, and PyData conferences. You can find the most recent ones via a
    simple web search.
Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
     Written by Andreas C. Mueller and Sarah Guido, this book includes a fuller treat‐
     ment of the topics in this chapter. If you’re interested in reviewing the fundamen‐
     tals of machine learning and pushing the Scikit-Learn toolkit to its limits, this is a
     great resource, written by one of the most prolific developers on the Scikit-Learn
     team.
Python Machine Learning
    Sebastian Raschka’s book focuses less on Scikit-Learn itself, and more on the
    breadth of machine learning tools available in Python. In particular, there is
    some very useful discussion on how to scale Python-based machine learning
    approaches to large and complex datasets.
