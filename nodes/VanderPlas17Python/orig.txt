What Is Data Science?
This is a book about doing data science with Python, which immediately begs the
question: what is data science? It’s a surprisingly hard definition to nail down, espe‐
cially given how ubiquitous the term has become. Vocal critics have variously dis‐
missed the term as a superfluous label (after all, what science doesn’t involve data?) or
a simple buzzword that only exists to salt résumés and catch the eye of overzealous
tech recruiters.
In my mind, these critiques miss something important. Data science, despite its hype-
laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills
that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across industry and
academia. This cross-disciplinary piece is key: in my mind, the best existing defini‐
tion of data science is illustrated by Drew Conway’s Data Science Venn Diagram, first
published on his blog in September 2010 (see Figure P-1).
