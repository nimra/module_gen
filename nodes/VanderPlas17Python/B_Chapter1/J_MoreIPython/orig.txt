Here the Increment column tells us how much each line affects the total memory
budget: observe that when we create and delete the list L, we are adding about 25 MB
of memory usage. This is on top of the background memory usage from the Python
interpreter itself.
For more information on %memit and %mprun, as well as their available options, use
the IPython help functionality (i.e., type %memit? at the IPython prompt).

More IPython Resources
In this chapter, we’ve just scratched the surface of using IPython to enable data sci‐
ence tasks. Much more information is available both in print and on the Web, and
here we’ll list some other resources that you may find helpful.

Web Resources
The IPython website
    The IPython website links to documentation, examples, tutorials, and a variety of
    other resources.
The nbviewer website
    This site shows static renderings of any IPython notebook available on the Inter‐
    net. The front page features some example notebooks that you can browse to see
    what other folks are using IPython for!
