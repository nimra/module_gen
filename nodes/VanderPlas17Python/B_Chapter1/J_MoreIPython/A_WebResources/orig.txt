          7     39.1 MiB     -7.4 MiB       return total

Here the Increment column tells us how much each line affects the total memory
budget: observe that when we create and delete the list L, we are adding about 25 MB
of memory usage. This is on top of the background memory usage from the Python
interpreter itself.
For more information on %memit and %mprun, as well as their available options, use
the IPython help functionality (i.e., type %memit? at the IPython prompt).

More IPython Resources
In this chapter, we’ve just scratched the surface of using IPython to enable data sci‐
ence tasks. Much more information is available both in print and on the Web, and
here we’ll list some other resources that you may find helpful.

Web Resources
The IPython website
    The IPython website links to documentation, examples, tutorials, and a variety of
    other resources.
The nbviewer website
    This site shows static renderings of any IPython notebook available on the Inter‐
    net. The front page features some example notebooks that you can browse to see
    what other folks are using IPython for!




30   | Chapter 1: IPython: Beyond Normal Python
A Gallery of Interesting IPython Notebooks
   This ever-growing list of notebooks, powered by nbviewer, shows the depth and
   breadth of numerical analysis you can do with IPython. It includes everything
   from short examples and tutorials to full-blown courses and books composed in
   the notebook format!
Video tutorials
    Searching the Internet, you will find many video-recorded tutorials on IPython.
    I’d especially recommend seeking tutorials from the PyCon, SciPy, and PyData
    conferences by Fernando Perez and Brian Granger, two of the primary creators
    and maintainers of IPython and Jupyter.

Books
Python for Data Analysis
    Wes McKinney’s book includes a chapter that covers using IPython as a data sci‐
    entist. Although much of the material overlaps what we’ve discussed here,
    another perspective is always helpful.
Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization
    This short book by Cyrille Rossant offers a good introduction to using IPython
    for data analysis.
IPython Interactive Computing and Visualization Cookbook
    Also by Cyrille Rossant, this book is a longer and more advanced treatment of
    using IPython for data science. Despite its name, it’s not just about IPython—it
    also goes into some depth on a broad range of data science topics.
Finally, a reminder that you can find help on your own: IPython’s ?-based help func‐
tionality (discussed in “Help and Documentation in IPython” on page 3) can be very
useful if you use it well and use it often. As you go through the examples here and
elsewhere, you can use it to familiarize yourself with all the tools that IPython has to
offer.
