Shell Commands in IPython
You can use any command that works at the command line in IPython by prefixing it
with the ! character. For example, the ls, pwd, and echo commands can be run as
follows:
     In [1]: !ls
     myproject.txt

     In [2]: !pwd
     /home/jake/projects/myproject

     In [3]: !echo "printing from the shell"
     printing from the shell


Passing Values to and from the Shell
Shell commands can not only be called from IPython, but can also be made to inter‐
act with the IPython namespace. For example, you can save the output of any shell
command to a Python list using the assignment operator:
     In [4]: contents = !ls

     In [5]: print(contents)
     ['myproject.txt']

     In [6]: directory = !pwd

     In [7]: print(directory)
     ['/Users/jakevdp/notebooks/tmp/myproject']
Note that these results are not returned as lists, but as a special shell return type
defined in IPython:
     In [8]: type(directory)
     IPython.utils.text.SList
This looks and acts a lot like a Python list, but has additional functionality, such as
the grep and fields methods and the s, n, and p properties that allow you to search,
filter, and display the results in convenient ways. For more information on these, you
can use IPython’s built-in help features.
Communication in the other direction—passing Python variables into the shell—is
possible through the {varname} syntax:
     In [9]: message = "hello from Python"

     In [10]: !echo {message}
     hello from Python
