# CHAPTER 8

# 
# What Is Data Science?
# Data science encompasses the tools and techniques for extracting information from
# data. Data science techniques draw extensively from the field of mathematics, statistics,
# and computation. However, data science is now encapsulated into software packages
# and libraries, thus making them easily accessible and consumable by the software
# development and engineering communities. This is a major factor to the rise of
# intelligence capabilities now integrated as a major staple in software products across all
# sorts of domains.
#      This chapter will discuss broadly on the opportunities for data science and big
# data analytics integration as part of the transformation portfolio of businesses and
# institutions and give an overview on the data science process as a reusable template for
# fulfilling data science projects.

# The Challenge of Big Data
# Due to the expansion of data at the turn of the twenty-first century epitomized by the
# so-called 3Vs of big data, which are volume, velocity, and variety. Volume refers to the
# increasing size of data, velocity the speed at which data is acquired, and variety the
# diverse types of data that are available. For others, this becomes 5Vs with the inclusion
# of value and veracity to mean the usefulness of data and the truthfulness of data,
# respectively. We have observed data volume blowout from the megabyte (MB) to the
# terabyte (TB) scale and now exploding past the petabyte (PB). We have to find new
# and improved means of storing and processing this ever-increasing dataset. Initially,
# this challenge of storage and data processing was addressed by the Hadoop ecosystem
# and other supporting frameworks, but even these have become expensive to manage
# and scale, and this is why there is a pivot to cloud-managed, elastic, secure, and
# high-­availability data storage and processing capabilities.

# Chapter 8    What Is Data Science?
# 
#      On the other hand, for most applications and business use cases, there is a need to
# carry out real-time analysis on data due to the vast amount of data created and available
# at a given moment. Previously, getting insights from data and unlocking value had
# been down to traditional analysis on batch data workloads using statistical tools such
# as Excel, Minitab, or SPSS. But in the era of big data, this is changing, as more and more
# businesses and institutions want to understand the information in their data at a real-­
# time or at worst near real-time pace.
#      Another vertical to the big data conundrum is that of variety. Formerly, a pre-defined
# structure had to be imposed on data in order to easily store them as well as make it
# easy for data analysis. However, a wide diversity of datasets are now collected and
# stored such as spatial maps, image data, video data, audio data, text data from emails
# and other documents, and sensor data. As a matter of fact, a far larger amount of
# datasets in the wild are unstructured. This led to the development of unstructured
# or semi-structured databases such as Elasticsearch, Solr, HBase, Cassandra, and
# MongoDB, to mention just a few.
# 
# 
# 
# The Data Science Opportunity
# In the new age, where data has inevitably and irreversibly become the new gold, the
# greatest needs of organizations are the skills required for data governance and analytics
# to unlock intelligence and value from data as well as the expertise to develop and
# productionize enterprise data products. This has led to new roles within the data science
# umbrella such as
#       •     Data analysts/scientist who specialize in mining intelligence
#             from data using statistical techniques and computational tools by
#             understanding the business use case
# 
#       •     Data engineers/architects who specialize in architecting and
#             managing the infrastructure for efficient big data pipelines by
#             ensuring that the data platform is redundant, scalable, secure, and
#             highly available
# 
#       •     Machine learning engineers who specialize in designing and
#             developing machine learning algorithms as well as incorporating
#             them into production systems for online or batch prediction services
