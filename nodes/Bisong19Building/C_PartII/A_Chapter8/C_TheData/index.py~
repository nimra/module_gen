# 
# 
# The Data Science Process
# The data science process involves components for data ingestion and serving of data
# models. However, we will discuss briefly on the steps for carrying out data analytics in
# lieu of data prediction modeling.
#     These steps consist of
# 
#       1. Data summaries: The vital statistical summaries of the datasets’
#          variables or features. This includes information such as the
#          number of variables, their data types, the number of observations,
#          and the count/percentage of missing data.
# 
#       2. Data visualization: This involves employing univariate and
#          multivariate data visualization methods to get a better intuition
#          on the properties of the data variables and their relationship with
#          each other. This includes metrics such as histograms, box and
#          whisker plots, and correlation plots.
# 
#       3. Data cleaning/preprocessing: This process involves sanitizing the
#          data to make it amenable for modeling. Data rarely comes clean
#          with each row representing an observation and each column an
#          entity. In this phase of a data science effort, the tasks involved
#          may include removing duplicate entries, choosing a strategy for
#          dealing with missing data, as well as converting
#          data features into numeric data types of encoded categories.
#          This phase may also involve carrying out statistical transformation
#          on the data features to normalize and/or standardize the data
#          elements. Data features of wildly differing scales can lead to poor
#          model results as they become more difficult for the learning
#          algorithm to converge to the global minimum.
# 
#       4. Feature engineering: This practice involves systematically pruning
#          the data feature space to only select those features relevant to the
#          modeling problem as part of the model task.
#          Good feature engineering is often the difference between an
#          average and high performant model.
#

# 
#                                                                                            69

# 
#       5. Data modeling and evaluation: This phase involves passing the
#          data through a learning algorithm to build a predictive model.
#          This process is usually an iterative process that involves constant
#          refinement in order to build a model that better minimizes the
#          cost function on the hold-out validation set and the test set.
# 
#    In this chapter, we provided a brief overview to the concept of data science, the
# challenge of big data, and its goal to unlock value from data. The next chapter will
# provide an introduction to programming with Python.
#

# 
# CHAPTER 9
# 
# 
# 
# Python
# Python is one of the preferred languages for data science in the industry primarily
# because of its simple syntax and the number of reusable machine learning/deep
# learning packages. These packages make it easy to develop data science products
# without getting bogged down with the internals of a particular algorithm or method.
# They have been written, debugged, and tested by the best experts in the field, as well as
# by a large supporting community of developers that contribute their time and expertise
# to maintain and improve them.
#     In this section, we will go through the foundations of programming with Python 3.
# This section forms a framework for working with higher-level packages such as NumPy,
# Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras. The programming paradigm we will cover
# in this chapter can be easily adapted or applied to similar languages, such as R, which is
# also commonly used in the data science industry.
#     The best way to work through this chapter and the successive chapters in this part is to
# work through the code by executing them on Google Colab or GCP Deep Learning VMs.
#

#  ata and Operations
# Fundamentally, programming involves storing data and operating on that data to
# generate information. Techniques for efficient data storage are studied in the field called
# data structures, while the techniques for operating on data are studied as algorithms.
#     Data is stored in a memory block on the computer. Think of a memory block as a
# container holding data (Figure 9-1). When data is operated upon, the newly processed
# data is also stored in memory. Data is operated by using arithmetic and boolean
# expressions and functions.
