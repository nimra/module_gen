# Chapter 8    What Is Data Science?
# 
#      On the other hand, for most applications and business use cases, there is a need to
# carry out real-time analysis on data due to the vast amount of data created and available
# at a given moment. Previously, getting insights from data and unlocking value had
# been down to traditional analysis on batch data workloads using statistical tools such
# as Excel, Minitab, or SPSS. But in the era of big data, this is changing, as more and more
# businesses and institutions want to understand the information in their data at a real-­
# time or at worst near real-time pace.
#      Another vertical to the big data conundrum is that of variety. Formerly, a pre-defined
# structure had to be imposed on data in order to easily store them as well as make it
# easy for data analysis. However, a wide diversity of datasets are now collected and
# stored such as spatial maps, image data, video data, audio data, text data from emails
# and other documents, and sensor data. As a matter of fact, a far larger amount of
# datasets in the wild are unstructured. This led to the development of unstructured
# or semi-structured databases such as Elasticsearch, Solr, HBase, Cassandra, and
# MongoDB, to mention just a few.
#

# The Data Science Opportunity
# In the new age, where data has inevitably and irreversibly become the new gold, the
# greatest needs of organizations are the skills required for data governance and analytics
# to unlock intelligence and value from data as well as the expertise to develop and
# productionize enterprise data products. This has led to new roles within the data science
# umbrella such as
#       •     Data analysts/scientist who specialize in mining intelligence
#             from data using statistical techniques and computational tools by
#             understanding the business use case
# 
#       •     Data engineers/architects who specialize in architecting and
#             managing the infrastructure for efficient big data pipelines by
#             ensuring that the data platform is redundant, scalable, secure, and
#             highly available
# 
#       •     Machine learning engineers who specialize in designing and
#             developing machine learning algorithms as well as incorporating
#             them into production systems for online or batch prediction services

# The Data Science Process
# The data science process involves components for data ingestion and serving of data
# models. However, we will discuss briefly on the steps for carrying out data analytics in
# lieu of data prediction modeling.
#     These steps consist of
# 
#       1. Data summaries: The vital statistical summaries of the datasets’
#          variables or features. This includes information such as the
#          number of variables, their data types, the number of observations,
#          and the count/percentage of missing data.
# 
#       2. Data visualization: This involves employing univariate and
#          multivariate data visualization methods to get a better intuition
#          on the properties of the data variables and their relationship with
#          each other. This includes metrics such as histograms, box and
#          whisker plots, and correlation plots.
# 
#       3. Data cleaning/preprocessing: This process involves sanitizing the
#          data to make it amenable for modeling. Data rarely comes clean
#          with each row representing an observation and each column an
#          entity. In this phase of a data science effort, the tasks involved
#          may include removing duplicate entries, choosing a strategy for
#          dealing with missing data, as well as converting
#          data features into numeric data types of encoded categories.
#          This phase may also involve carrying out statistical transformation
#          on the data features to normalize and/or standardize the data
#          elements. Data features of wildly differing scales can lead to poor
#          model results as they become more difficult for the learning
#          algorithm to converge to the global minimum.
# 
#       4. Feature engineering: This practice involves systematically pruning
#          the data feature space to only select those features relevant to the
#          modeling problem as part of the model task.
#          Good feature engineering is often the difference between an
#          average and high performant model.
