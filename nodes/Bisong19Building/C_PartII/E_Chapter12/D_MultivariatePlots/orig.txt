 ultivariate Plots

pairwise plot, parallel coordinate plots, and the covariance matrix plot.

 catter Plot
Scatter plot exposes the relationships between two variables in a dataset. The outputs
with matplotlib and seaborn are shown in Figure 12-9 and Figure 12-10, respectively.

#   create the dataset
x   = np.random.sample(100)
y   = 0.9 * np.asarray(x) + 1 + np.random.uniform(0,0.8, size=(100,))
