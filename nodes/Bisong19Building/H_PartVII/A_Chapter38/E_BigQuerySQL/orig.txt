BigQuery SQL
In this section, we’ll have an overview of SQL by executing some examples that gives a
broad perspective of what can be achieved with SQL. New users who have not used SQL
before will benefit from this section. Also, SQL is amazingly easy and intuitive to use
that non-technical people like personnel in marketing and sales are experts at this even
sometimes more than programmers. It is an expressive declarative language.
    BigQuery works with both the standard SQL which supports SQL 2011 standard and
the legacy SQL syntax which is a non-standard variant of SQL. However, standard SQL is
the preferred query syntax for BigQuery. In experimenting with SQL, we will work with
the census_bureau_international public dataset. The following queries are available in
the chapter notebook of the book repository.


Filtering
The following query selects the fertility rate for each country in the year 2018 from the
‘age_specific_fertility_rates’ table in the ‘census_bureau_international’ dataset. The
resulting table is arranged in descending order.

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT
  country_name AS country,
  total_fertility_rate AS fertility_rate
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.age_specific_fertility_
   rates`
                                                                                        499
