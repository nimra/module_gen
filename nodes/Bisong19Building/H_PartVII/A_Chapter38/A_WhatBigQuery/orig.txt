of ­business intelligence and analytics personnel to more easily harness the predictive
power of using machine learning for business forecasting and decision-making.



What BigQuery Is Not
As powerful and widely purposed as BigQuery is, it may not be properly suited for some
use cases:

      •   BigQuery is not a replacement for a relational database. Some
          business use cases may involve a large number of table row updates;
          in such an instance, BigQuery is most likely not the data storage
          solution of choice, as relational databases are well suited for such
          highly transactional tasks. GCP offers the Cloud SQL and Cloud
          Spanner as parts of its managed relational products.

      •   BigQuery is not a NoSQL database. Data stored in BigQuery must
          have a schema. NoSQL is a schema-less data storage solution. GCP
          also has Cloud BigTable and Cloud Datastore, which are highly
          scalable and performant managed NoSQL products.



Getting Started with BigQuery
BigQuery can be accessed and used via a variety of ways; they include

      •   The BigQuery web UI
      •   The command-line tool, ‘bq’

      •   The client API libraries for programmatic access

    In this section, we will introduce BigQuery by working with the web UI, because it
gives a graphical view of the datasets and tables within BigQuery and is good for quick
execution of queries on the query engine.
    To open BigQuery from the GCP dashboard, click the triple dash on the top-left
corner and select BigQuery from the product section labeled Big Data as shown in
Figure 38-1.
