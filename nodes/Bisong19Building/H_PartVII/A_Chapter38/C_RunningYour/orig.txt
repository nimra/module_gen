Chapter 38    Google BigQuery


Running Your First Query
For our first query, we will work with the ‘census_bureau_international’ dataset which
“provides estimates of country populations since 1950 and projections through 2050.” In
this query, we select a country and their life expectancy (for both sexes) in the year 2018.

SELECT
  country_name,
  life_expectancy
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.mortality_life_
   expectancy`
WHERE
  year = 2018
ORDER BY
  life_expectancy DESC

      A sample of the query result is shown in Figure 38-4 under Query results.

   After typing the query in the Query editor, the following should be noted, as
numbered in Figure 38-4:

      1. Click the ‘Run query’ button to execute the query.

      2. The green status indicator shows that the query is a valid SQL
         statement and shows by the side an estimate of the query size
         estimation.

      3. The query results can be easily analyzed and visualized using Data
         Studio.

      4. We can see that the query completed in just over a second.



Loading Data into BigQuery
In this simple data ingestion example, we will load a CSV file stored on Google Cloud
Storage (GCS) into BigQuery. In GCP, Google Cloud Storage is a general-purpose storage
location for all variety of file types and is preferred as a staging area or an archival
repository for data. Let’s walk through the following steps.


Staging the Data in GCS
Let’s go through the steps to stage the data in Google Cloud Storage:

      1. Activate Cloud Shell as shown in Figure 38-5.
