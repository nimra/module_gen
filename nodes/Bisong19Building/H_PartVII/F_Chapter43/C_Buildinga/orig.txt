on Cloud AutoML NLP
This section will walk through creating a document dataset and building a custom
language classification model on AutoML Vision.

     1. From the Cloud AutoML NLP dashboard, click NEW DATASET as
        shown in Figure 43-­5.

     2. To create a Dataset on Cloud AutoML NLP, set the following
        parameters as shown in Figure 43-6:




                                                                                    605

             b. Select a CSV file on Cloud Storage (this is the CSV file placed on the bucket
                created when Cloud AutoML was configured that contains the path to the
                text documents): gs://quantum-ally-219323-lcm/file/data.csv.
             c. Click CREATE DATASET to begin importing images (see Figure 43-7).

     3. After importing the Dataset, click TRAIN (see Figure 43-8) to
        initiate the process of building a custom language classification
        model.

     4. In this example, we have a good enough number of training
        examples as seen in Figure 43-9, so hopefully, it makes sense
        to expect a good language classification model. Click START
        TRAINING to begin the training job.

      5. Accept the default model name, and click START TRAINING (see
         Figure 43-10) to begin building the model as seen in Figure 43-11.
         Note that this training might take about an hour to complete. When
         done, the user will get an email of completion.

        phase lasted for approximately 4 hours and 45 minutes.

     7. AutoML NLP sets aside a portion of the documents as a test set
        in order to evaluate the quality of the model after training (see
        Figure 43-13). The F1 plot shows the trade-­off between precision
        and recall. Also, a confusion matrix provides further insight into
        the model quality (see Figure 43-14).




                                                                                   609

     8. The custom text classification model is exposed as a REST
        or Python API for integration into software applications as a
        prediction service (see Figure 43-15). We can test our model by
        uploading a sample image for classification. Figure 43-16 passes
        a clean text example to the model and it predicts correctly with a
        probability of 98%, while Figure 43-17 passes a toxic text example
        to the model. This example is also correctly classified with a
        probability score of 99%.

Google AutoML Cloud Vision. In the next chapter, we will build an end-to-end data
science product on GCP.

Model to Predict the
Critical Temperature
of Superconductors
This chapter builds a regression machine learning model to predict the critical
temperature of superconductors. The features for this dataset were derived based on the
following superconductor properties:

       •    Atomic mass

       •    First ionization energy

       •    Atomic radius

       •    Density

       •    Electron affinity
       •    Fusion heat

       •    Thermal conductivity

       •    Valence
     And for each property, the mean, weighted mean, geometric mean, weighted
geometric mean, entropy, weighted entropy, range, weighted range, standard deviation,
and weighted standard deviation are extracted. Thus, this results in a total number of
8 x 10 = 80 features. In addition to this, a feature that contains the number of elements in
the superconductor is added to the design matrix. The predictor variable is the critical
temperature of the superconductor. Hence, the dataset has a total of 81 features and
21,263 rows.

                                                                                          613
