Preparing the Training Dataset
Before building a custom image recognition model with AutoML Cloud Vision, the
dataset must be prepared in a particular format; they include

      1. For training, JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, BMP, TIFF, and ICO image
         formats are supported with a maximum size of 30mb per image.

      2. For inference, the image formats JPEG, PNG, and GIF are
         supported with each image being of maximum size 1.5mb.

      3. It is best to place each image category into containing sub-folder
         within an image folder For example:

         •      [image-directory]

               •   [image-class-1-dir]

               •   [image-class-2-dir]

               •   …

               •   [image-class-n-dir]

      4. Next, a CSV must be created that points to the paths of the images
         and their corresponding label. AutoML uses the CSV file to point
         to the location of the training images and their labels. The CSV
         file is placed in the same GCS bucket containing the image files.
         Use the bucket automatically created when AutoML Vision was
         configured. In our case, this bucket is named ‘gs://quantum-ally-
         219323-vcm’. We use the following code segment to create the CSV
         file used in the cereal classifier example.

             import os
             import numpy as np
             import pandas as pd

             directory = 'cereal_photos/

             data = []

             # go through sub-directories in the image directory and get the
             image paths

   for subdir, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
       for file in files:
           filepath = subdir + os.sep + file

           if filepath.endswith(".jpg"):
               
               entry = ['{}/{}'.format('gs://quantum-ally-219323-­
               vcm',filepath), os.path.basename(subdir)]
               data.append(entry)

   # convert to Pandas DataFrame
   data_pd = pd.DataFrame(np.array(data))

   # export CSV
   data_pd.to_csv("data.csv", header=None, index=None)

5. The preceding code will result in a CSV looking like the following
   sample:

   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/apple_cinnamon_
   cheerios/001.jpg,apple_cinnamon_cheerios
   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/apple_cinnamon_
   cheerios/002.jpg,apple_cinnamon_cheerios
   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/apple_cinnamon_
   cheerios/003.jpg,apple_cinnamon_cheerios
   ...
   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/none_of_the_above/
   images_(97).jpg,none_of_the_above
   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/none_of_the_above/
   images_(98).jpg,none_of_the_above
   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/none_of_the_above/
   images_(99).jpg,none_of_the_above
   ...
   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/sugar_crisp/001.
   jpg,sugar_crisp
   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/sugar_crisp/002.
   jpg,sugar_crisp
   gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/sugar_crisp/003.
   jpg,sugar_crisp

                                                                               587

          The first part is the image path or URI, while the other is the
          image label.

      6. When preparing the image dataset, it is useful to have a ‘None_
         of_the_above’ image class. This class will contain random images
         that do not belong to any of the predicted classes. Adding this
         class can have an overall effect on the model accuracy.

      7. Clone the GitHub book repository to the Notebook instance.
      8. Navigate to the folder chapter and copy the image files to the GCS
         bucket.

             gsutil cp -r cereal_photos gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm

      9. Copy the CSV data file containing the image paths and their labels
         to the GCS bucket.

             gsutil cp data.csv gs://quantum-ally-219323-vcm/cereal_photos/

AutoML Vision
In AutoML for Cloud Vision, a dataset contains the images that will be used in building
the classifier and their corresponding labels. This section will walk through creating a
dataset and building a custom image model on AutoML Vision.
      1. From the Cloud AutoML Vision Dashboard, click NEW DATASET
         as shown in Figure 42-8.
