    os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = str(
        tf.logging.__dict__[args.verbosity] / 10)

    # Run the training job
    hparams = hparam.HParams(**args.__dict__)
    train_and_evaluate(hparams)

      Note the following in the preceding code:

        •   The method ‘_get_session_config_from_env_var()’ defines the
            configuration for the runtime environment on Cloud MLE for the
            Estimator.

        •   The method ‘train_and_evaluate()’ does a number of orchestration
            events including

            •    Routing training and evaluation datasets to the model function in
                 ‘model.py’

            •    Setting up the runtime environment of the Estimator

            •    Passing hyper-parameters to the Estimator model

        •   The line of code “if __name__ == ‘__main__’:” defines the entry
            point of the Python script via the terminal session. In this script, the
            code will receive inputs from the terminal through the ‘argparse.
            ArgumentParser()’ method.



Training on Cloud MLE
The training execution codes are bash commands stored in a shell script. Shell scripts
end with the suffix ‘.sh’.


Running a Single Instance Training Job
The bash codes for executing training on a single instance on Cloud MLE is shown in the
following. Change the bucket names accordingly.
