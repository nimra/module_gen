Google Cloud
Machine Learning
Engine (Cloud MLE)
The Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine, simply known as Cloud MLE, is a managed
Google infrastructure for training and serving “large-scale” machine learning models.
Cloud ML Engine is a part of GCP AI Platform. This managed infrastructure can train
large-scale machine learning models built with TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, or
XGBoost. It also provides modes of serving or consuming the trained models either as
an online or batch prediction service. Using online prediction, the infrastructure scales
in response to request throughout, while with the batch mode, Cloud MLE can provide
inference for TBs of data.
    Two important features of Cloud MLE is the ability to perform distribution training
and automatic hyper-parameter tuning of your models while training. The big advantage
of automatic hyper-parameter tuning is the ability to find the best set of parameters
that minimize the model cost or loss function. This saves time of development hours in
iterative experiments.



The Cloud MLE Train/Deploy Process
The high-level overview of the train/deploy process on Cloud MLE is depicted in
Figure 41-1:

       1. The data for training/inference is kept on GCS.

       2. The execution script uses the application logic to train the model
          on Cloud MLE using the training data.
