# Chapter 13   What Is Machine Learning?
# 
# 
# The Role of Data
# Data is at the core of machine learning. It is central to the current evolution and further
# advancement of this field. Just as it is for humans, it is the same way for machines.
# Learning is not possible without data.
#     Humans learn how to perform tasks by collecting information from the
# Environment. This information is the data the brain uses to construct patterns and
# gain an understanding of the Environment. For a human being, data is captured
# through the sense organs. For example, the eyes capture visual data, the ears capture
# auditory data, the skin receives tactile data, while the nose and tongue detect olfactory
# and taste data, respectively.
#     As with humans, this same process of learning from data is replicated with
# machines. Letâ€™s take, for example, the task of identifying spam emails. In this example,
# the computer is provided email examples as data. It then uses an algorithm to learn to
# distinguish spam emails from regular emails.
# 
# 
# 
# The Cost of Data
# Data is expensive to collect, and high-quality data is even more costly to capture due
# to the associated costs in storing and cleaning the data. Over the years, the paucity of
# data had limited the performance of machine learning methods. However, in the early
# 1990s, the Internet was born, and by the dawn of the century, it became a super highway
# for data distribution. As a result, large and diverse data became readily available for the
# research and development of machine learning products across various domains.
#     In this chapter, we covered the definition and history of machine learning and the
# importance of data. Next, we will take it further by discussing the principles of machine
# learning in Chapter 14.
