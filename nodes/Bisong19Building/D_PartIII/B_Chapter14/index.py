# 
# Principles of Learning
# Machine learning is, for the most part, sub-divided into three components based on the
# approach to the learning problem. The three predominant categories of learning are the
# supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning schemes. In this chapter, we will
# go over supervised learning schemes in detail and also touch upon unsupervised and
# reinforcement learning schemes to a lesser extent.
#     The focus on supervised learning is for a variety of reasons. Firstly, they are the
# predominant techniques used for building machine learning products in industry;
# secondly, as you will soon learn, they are easy to ground truth and assess their
# performances before being deployed as part of a large-scale production pipeline. Letâ€™s
# examine each of the three schemes.
