CHAPTER 17



Learning Algorithms
In this section, we introduce a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms. The algorithms presented here provide a foundation for understanding other
machine learning methods (e.g., linear and logistic regression), and others like Random
forests and Extreme Stochastic Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are widely used in applied
machine learning.
    We will survey the various learning algorithms from a conceptual level. In general,
the discussion will cut across

       •    What a particular algorithm is all about and how it works.

       •    How we interpret the results of the learning algorithm.

       •    What various ways it can be optimized to improve performance in
            certain circumstances.



Classes of Supervised Algorithms
Supervised machine learning algorithms are broadly classified into
       •    Linear

       •    Non-linear
       •    Ensemble methods
