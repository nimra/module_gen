Learning Techniques
with Scikit-learn
This chapter will cover using Scikit-learn to implement machine learning models using
techniques such as

       •    Feature engineering

       •    Resampling methods

       •    Model evaluation methods

       •    Pipelines for streamlining machine learning workflows

       •    Techniques for model tuning



F eature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of systematically choosing the set of features in the
dataset that are useful and relevant to the learning problem. It is often the case that
irrelevant features negatively affect the performance of the model. This section will
review some techniques implemented in Scikit-learn for selecting relevant features from
a dataset. The techniques surveyed include

       •    Statistical tests to select the best k features using the
            SelectKBest module

       •    Recursive feature elimination (RFE) to recursively remove irrelevant
            features from the dataset
                                                                                          287
