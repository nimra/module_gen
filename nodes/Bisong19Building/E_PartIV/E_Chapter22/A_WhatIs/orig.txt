Support Vector Machines
Support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm for learning classification
and regression models. To build intuition, we will consider the case of learning a
classification model with SVM. Given a dataset with two target classes that are linearly
separable, it turns out that there exists an infinite number of lines that can discriminate
between the two classes (see Figure 22-1). The goal of the SVM is to find the best line that
separates the two classes. In higher dimensions, this line is called a hyperplane.

What Is a Hyperplane?
A hyperplane is a line or more technically called a discriminant that separates two
classes in n-dimensional space. When a hyperplane is drawn in 2-D space, it is called a
line. In 3-D space, it is called a plane, and in dimensions greater than 3, the discriminant
is called a hyperplane (see Figure 22-2). For any n-dimensional world, we have n-1
hyperplanes.

plane. For dimension greater than 3, visualization becomes difficult.

Finding the Optimal Hyperplane
The best hyperplane that linearly separates two classes is identified as the line lying at
the largest margin from the nearest vectors at the boundary of the two classes.
     In Figure 22-3, we observe that the best hyperplane is the line at the exact center
of the two classes and constitutes the largest margin between both classes. Hence, this
optimal hyperplane is also known as the largest margin classifier.
