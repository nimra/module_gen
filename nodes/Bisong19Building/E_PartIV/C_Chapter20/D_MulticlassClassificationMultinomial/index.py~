# M
# Regression
# In multi-class or multinomial logistic regression, the labels of the dataset contain more
# than 2 classes. The multinomial logistic regression setup (i.e., the cost function and
# optimization procedure) is structurally similar to logistic regression; the only difference
# is that the output of logistic regression is 2 classes, while multinomial has greater than 2
# classes (see Figure 20-6).
#      In Figure 20-6, the multi-class logistic regression builds a one-vs.-rest classifier to
# construct decision boundaries for the different class memberships.

# Chapter 20     Logistic Regression

#      At this point, we introduce a critical function in machine learning called the softmax
# function. The softmax function is used to compute the probability that an instance
# belongs to one of the K classes when K > 2. We will see the softmax function show up
# again when we discuss (artificial) neural networks.
#      In order to build a classification model with k classes, the multinomial logistic model
# is formally defined as
# 
#                                  ŷ ( k ) = q 0k + q1k x1 + q 2k x 2 +¼+ qnk xn
# 
# 
#       The preceding model takes into consideration the parameters for the k different classes.
#       The softmax function is formally written as
# 
#                                                                                yˆ ( k )i
#                                                                            e
#                                      p ( k ) = s ( yˆ ( k ) )i =                  yˆ ( k ) j  ( k j
#                                                                    å
#                                                                        K
#                                                                        j =1
#                                                                            e
# 
# 
#       where
# 
#         •   i = {1, …, K} classes.
# 
#         •   s ( ŷ ( k ) )i outputs the probability estimates that an example in the
#             training dataset belongs to one of the K classes.
# 
#     The cost function for learning the class labels in a multinomial logistic regression
# model is called the cross-entropy cost function. Gradient descent is used to find the
# optimal values of the parameter θ that will minimize the cost function to predict the
# class with the highest probability estimate accurately.

# 
# Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn
# In this example, we will implement a multi-class logistic regression model with Scikit-­
# learn. The model will predict the three species of flowers from the Iris dataset. The
# dataset contains 150 observations and 4 features. For this example, we use the accuracy
# metric and confusion matrix to access the model’s performance.
