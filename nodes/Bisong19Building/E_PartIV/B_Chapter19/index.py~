# Linear Regression
# The fundamental idea behind the linear regression algorithm is that it assumes a linear
# relationship between the features of the dataset. As a result of the pre-defined structure
# that is imposed on the parameters of the model, it is also called a parametric learning
# algorithm. Linear regression is used to predict targets that contain real values. As we will
# see later in Chapter 20 on logistic regression, the linear regression model is not adequate
# to deal with learning problems whose targets are categorical.
# 
# 
# 
# The Regression Model
# In linear regression, the prevailing assumption is that the target variable (i.e., the unit
# that we want to predict) can be modeled as a linear combination of the features.
#      A linear combination is simply the addition of a certain number of vectors that are
# scaled (or adjusted) by some arbitrary constant. A vector is a mathematical construct for
# representing a set of numbers.
#      For example, let us assume a randomly generated dataset consisting of two features
# and a target variable. The dataset has 50 observations (see Figure 19-1).
