Linear Regression
The fundamental idea behind the linear regression algorithm is that it assumes a linear
relationship between the features of the dataset. As a result of the pre-defined structure
that is imposed on the parameters of the model, it is also called a parametric learning
algorithm. Linear regression is used to predict targets that contain real values. As we will
see later in Chapter 20 on logistic regression, the linear regression model is not adequate
to deal with learning problems whose targets are categorical.



The Regression Model
In linear regression, the prevailing assumption is that the target variable (i.e., the unit
that we want to predict) can be modeled as a linear combination of the features.
     A linear combination is simply the addition of a certain number of vectors that are
scaled (or adjusted) by some arbitrary constant. A vector is a mathematical construct for
representing a set of numbers.
     For example, let us assume a randomly generated dataset consisting of two features
and a target variable. The dataset has 50 observations (see Figure 19-1).
