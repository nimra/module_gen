# F inding the Regression Line – How Do We Optimize
#  the Parameters of the Linear Model?
# To find the regression line, we need to define the cost function, which is also called the
# loss function. Remember that the cost in machine learning is the error measure that
# the learning algorithm minimizes. We can also define the cost as the penalty when the
# model outputs an incorrect prediction.
#      In the case of the linear regression model, the cost function is defined as half the sum
# of the squared difference between the predicted value and the actual value. The linear
# regression cost function is called the squared error cost function and is written as
# 
#                                              1
#                                      C (q ) = å ( yˆ - y )
#                                                            2
# 
#                                              2
# 
#     To put it more simply, the closer the approximate value of the target variable ŷ is to
# the actual variable y, the lower our cost and the better our model.
#     Having defined the cost function, an optimization algorithm such as gradient
# descent is used to minimize the cost C(θ) by updating the weights of the linear
# regression model.
# 
# 
# 
# How Do We Interpret the Linear Regression Model?
# In machine learning, the focus of linear regression differs slightly from traditional
# statistics. In statistics, the goal of a regression model is to understand the relationships
# between the features and targets by interpreting p-values, whereas in machine learning,
# the goal of the linear regression model is to predict the targets given new samples.
#     Figure 19-4 shows a regression model with a line of best fit that optimizes the
# squared difference between the data features and the targets. This difference is also
# called the residuals (shown as the purple vertical lines in Figure 19-4). What we care
# about in a linear regression model is to minimize the error between the predicted labels
# and the actual labels in the dataset.

# Figure 19-4. Linear regression model showing residuals
# 
#     If all the points in Figure 19-4 entirely fall on the predicted regression line, then the
# error will be 0. In interpreting the regression model, we want the error measure to be as
# low as possible.
#     However, our emphasis is to obtain a low error measure when we evaluate our model
# on the test dataset. Recall that the test of learning is when a model can generalize to
# examples that it was not exposed to during training.
# 
# 
# 
# Linear Regression with Scikit-learn
# In this example, we will implement a linear regression model with Scikit-learn. The
# model will predict house prices from the Boston house-prices dataset. The dataset
# contains 506 observations and 13 features.
#     We begin by importing the following packages:
# 
# sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression: function that implements the
# LinearRegression model.
# sklearn.datasets: function to load sample datasets integrated with scikit-­
# learn for experimental and learning purposes.
# sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: function that partitions the
# dataset into train and test splits.
# sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error: function to load the evaluation metric
# for checking the performance of the model.
# 
# 
# 
#                                                                                          235
