CHAPTER 28



Neural Network
Foundations
Building on the inspiration of the biological neuron, the artificial neural network
(ANN) is a society of connectionist agents that learn and transfer information from
one artificial neuron to the other. As data transfers between neurons, a hierarchy
of representations or a hierarchy of features is learned, hence the name deep
representation learning or deep learning.



T he Architecture
An artificial neural network is composed of

       •    An input layer

       •    Hidden layer(s)

       •    An output layer
