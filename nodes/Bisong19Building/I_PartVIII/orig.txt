The microservice architecture is an approach for developing and deploying enterprise
cloud-native software applications that involve separating the core business capabilities
of the application into decoupled components. Each business capability represents
some functionality that the application provides as services to the end user. The idea
of microservices is in contrast to the monolithic architecture which involves building
applications as a composite of its “individual” capabilities. See an illustration in
Figure 45-1.
