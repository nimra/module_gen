                                      Chapter 45   Containers and Google Kubernetes Engine


Build and Run a Simple Docker Container
Clone the book repository to run this example in Cloud Shell; we have a bash script titled
date-script.sh in the chapter folder. The script assigns the current date to a variable and
then prints out the date to the console. The Dockerfile will copy the script from the local
machine to the docker container file system and execute the shell script when running the
container. The Dockerfile to build the container is stored in docker-intro/hello-­world.

# navigate to the folder with images
cd docker-intro/hello-world

   Let’s view the bash script.

cat date-script.sh

#! /bin/sh
DATE="$(date)"
echo "Todays date is $DATE"

   Let’s view the Dockerfile.

# view the Dockerfile
cat Dockerfile

# base image for building container
FROM docker.io/alpine
# add maintainer label
LABEL maintainer="dvdbisong@gmail.com"
# copy script from local machine to container file system
COPY date-script.sh /date-script.sh
# execute script
CMD sh date-script.sh

   The Docker image will be built off the Alpine Linux package. See https://hub.
docker.com/_/alpine. The CMD routine executes the script when the container runs.

 uild the Image
Run the following command to build the Docker image.

# build the image
docker build -t ekababisong.org/first_image .
                                                                                        661
