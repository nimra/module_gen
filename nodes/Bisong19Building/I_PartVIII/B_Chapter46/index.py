# Kubeflow and Kubeflow
# Pipelines
# Machine learning is often and rightly viewed as the use of mathematical algorithms to
# teach the computer to learn tasks that are computationally infeasible to program as a set
# of specified instructions. However, it turns out that these algorithms constitute only a
# small fraction of the overall learning pipeline from an engineering perspective. Building
# high-performant and dynamic learning models includes a number of other critical
# components. These components actually dominate the space of concerns for delivering
# an end-to-end machine learning product.
#     A typical machine learning production pipeline looks like the illustration in
# Figure 46-1.

# Figure 46-1. Machine learning production pipeline
# 
#     From the preceding diagram, observe that the process flow in the pipeline is
# iterative. This repetitive pattern is central to machine learning experimentation, design,
# and deployment.
# 
# 
# 
# The Efficiency Challenge
# It is easy to recognize that the pipeline requires a significant amount of development
# operations for the seamless transition from one component to another when building a
# learning model. This interoperability of parts has given rise to Machine Learning Ops,
# also known as MLOps. The term is coined as an amalgam of Machine Learning and
# DevOps.
#       The conventional way of doing machine learning is to perform all of the Experiment
# and development work in Jupyter notebooks, and the model is exported and sent off to
# the software development team for deployment and endpoint generation for integration
