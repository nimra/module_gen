CHAPTER 46



Kubeflow and Kubeflow
Pipelines
Machine learning is often and rightly viewed as the use of mathematical algorithms to
teach the computer to learn tasks that are computationally infeasible to program as a set
of specified instructions. However, it turns out that these algorithms constitute only a
small fraction of the overall learning pipeline from an engineering perspective. Building
high-performant and dynamic learning models includes a number of other critical
components. These components actually dominate the space of concerns for delivering
an end-to-end machine learning product.
    A typical machine learning production pipeline looks like the illustration in
Figure 46-1.

Figure 46-1. Machine learning production pipeline

    From the preceding diagram, observe that the process flow in the pipeline is
iterative. This repetitive pattern is central to machine learning experimentation, design,
and deployment.



The Efficiency Challenge
It is easy to recognize that the pipeline requires a significant amount of development
operations for the seamless transition from one component to another when building a
learning model. This interoperability of parts has given rise to Machine Learning Ops,
also known as MLOps. The term is coined as an amalgam of Machine Learning and
DevOps.
      The conventional way of doing machine learning is to perform all of the Experiment
and development work in Jupyter notebooks, and the model is exported and sent off to
the software development team for deployment and endpoint generation for integration
