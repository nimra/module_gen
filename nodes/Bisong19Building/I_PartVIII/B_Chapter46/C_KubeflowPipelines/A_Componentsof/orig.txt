Components of Kubeflow Pipelines
A Pipeline describes a machine learning workflow, where each component of the
pipeline is a self-contained set of codes that are packaged as Docker images. Each
pipeline can be uploaded individually and shared on the Kubeflow Pipelines user
interface (UI). A pipeline takes inputs (parameters) required to run the pipeline and the
inputs and outputs of each component.
    The Kubeflow Pipelines platform consists of

      •   A user interface (UI) for managing and tracking Experiments, jobs,
          and runs

      •   An engine for scheduling multi-step ML workflows

      •   An SDK for defining and manipulating pipelines and components

      •   Notebooks for interacting with the system using the SDK (taken from
          www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/pipelines-overview/)
