CHAPTER 6



JupyterLab Notebooks
Google deep learning virtual machines (VMs) are a part of GCP AI Platform. It provisions
a Compute Engine instance that comes pre-configured with the relevant software
packages for carrying out analytics and modeling tasks. It also makes available high-­
performance computing TPU and GPU processing capabilities at a single click. These
VMs expose a JupyterLab notebook environment for analyzing data and designing
machine learning models.
    In this chapter, we’ll launch a JupyterLab notebook instance using the web-based
console and the command line.



Provisioning a Notebook Instance
The following steps provide a walk-through for deploying a Notebook instance on a deep
learning VM:

       1. In the group named ‘ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE’ on the GCP
          resources drawer, click the arrow beside ‘AI Platform’ and select
          ‘Notebooks’ as shown in Figure 6-1.
