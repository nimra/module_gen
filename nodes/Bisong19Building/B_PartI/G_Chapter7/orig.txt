CHAPTER 7



Google Colaboratory
Google Colaboratory more commonly referred to as “Google Colab” or just simply
“Colab” is a research project for prototyping machine learning models on powerful
hardware options such as GPUs and TPUs. It provides a serverless Jupyter notebook
environment for interactive development. Google Colab is free to use like other G Suite
products.



Starting Out with Colab
The following steps provide a walk-through for launching a Notebook on Google Colab:

       1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ and log in using
          your existing Google account to access the Colab homepage
          (see Figure 7-1).
