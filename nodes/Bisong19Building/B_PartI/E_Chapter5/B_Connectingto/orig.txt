      6. Click ‘Create’ in Figure 5-6 to deploy the VM instance.



Connecting to the VM Instance
In the VM instances page that lists the created VMs, click ‘SSH’ beside the created
instance as shown in Figure 5-7. This launches a new window with terminal access to the
created VM as shown in Figures 5-8 and 5-9.

Tearing Down the Instance
It is good practice to delete compute instances that are no longer in use to save cost for
utilizing GCP resources. To delete a compute instance, on the ‘VM instances’ page, select
the instance for deletion and click ‘DELETE’ (in red) as shown in Figure 5-10.
