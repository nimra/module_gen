# Figure 5-10. Delete the VM instance
# 
# Working with GCE from the Command Line
# In this section, we’ll sample the commands for creating and deleting a compute instance
# on GCP using the command-line interface. To create a compute instance using ‘gcloud’
# from the command-line interface, there are a variety of options that can be added to the
# commands for different specifications of the machine. To learn more about a command,
# attach ‘help’ after the command:
# 
#       •   Provisioning a VM instance: To create a VM instance, use the code
#           syntax
# 
#           gcloud compute instances create [INSTANCE_NAME]
# 
#           For example, let’s create an instance named ‘ebisong-howad-instance’
# 
#           gcloud compute instances create ebisong-howad-instance

#     This chapter went through the step for launching a compute machine instance on
# GCP. It covered working with the web-based cloud console and using commands via the
# shell terminal.
#     In the next chapter, we’ll discuss how to launch a Jupyter notebook instance on GCP
# called JupyterLab. A notebook provides an interactive environment for analytics, data
# science, and prototyping machine learning models.

# 
# JupyterLab Notebooks
# Google deep learning virtual machines (VMs) are a part of GCP AI Platform. It provisions
# a Compute Engine instance that comes pre-configured with the relevant software
# packages for carrying out analytics and modeling tasks. It also makes available high-­
# performance computing TPU and GPU processing capabilities at a single click. These
# VMs expose a JupyterLab notebook environment for analyzing data and designing
# machine learning models.
#     In this chapter, we’ll launch a JupyterLab notebook instance using the web-based
# console and the command line.
# 
# 
# 
# Provisioning a Notebook Instance
# The following steps provide a walk-through for deploying a Notebook instance on a deep
# learning VM:
# 
#        1. In the group named ‘ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE’ on the GCP
#           resources drawer, click the arrow beside ‘AI Platform’ and select
#           ‘Notebooks’ as shown in Figure 6-1.
