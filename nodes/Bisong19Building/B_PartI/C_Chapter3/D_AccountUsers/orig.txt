Chapter 3   The Google Cloud SDK and Web CLI


Accessing Cloud Platform Services
To access the resources on the cloud platform, click the triple dash in the top-right
corner of the window. Grouped service offerings are used to organize the resources. For
example, in Figure 3-7, we can see the products under STORAGE: Bigtable, Datastore,
Storage, SQL, and Spanner.

Account Users and Permissions
GCP allows you to define security roles and permissions for every resource in a
specific project. This feature is particularly useful when a project scales beyond one
user. New roles and permissions are created for a user through the IAM & admin tab
(see Figures 3-Â­8 and 3-9).

The Cloud Shell
The Cloud Shell is a vital component for working with GCP resources. Cloud Shell
provisions an ephemeral virtual machine with command-line tools installed for
interacting with GCP resources. It gives the user cloud-based command-line access to
manipulate resources directly from within the GCP perimeter without installing the
Google Cloud SDK on a local machine.
    The Cloud Shell is accessed by clicking the prompt icon in the top-left corner of the
window. See Figures 3-9, 3-10, and 3-11.
