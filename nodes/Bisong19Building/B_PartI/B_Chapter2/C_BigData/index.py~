# Big Data and Analytics
# Google Cloud Platform offers a range of serverless big data and analytics solutions for
# data warehousing, stream, and batch analytics, cloud-managed Hadoop ecosystems,
# cloud-based messaging systems, and data exploration. These services provide multiple
# perspectives to mining/generating real-time intelligence from big data.
#     Examples of big data services shown in Figure 2-3 include Cloud BigQuery
# (serverless analytics/data warehousing platform), Cloud Dataproc (fully managed
# Hadoop/Apache Spark infrastructure), Cloud Dataflow (Batch/Stream data
# transformation/processing), Cloud Dataprep (serverless infrastructure for cleaning
# unstructured/structured data for analytics), Cloud Datastudio (data visualization/report
# dashboards), Cloud Datalab (managed Jupyter notebook for machine learning/data
# analytics), and Cloud Pub/Sub (serverless messaging infrastructure).

# 
# 
# Cloud Artificial Intelligence (AI)
# Google Cloud AI offers cloud services for businesses and individuals to leverage pre-Â­
# trained models for custom artificial intelligence tasks through the use of REST APIs.
# It also exposes services for developing custom models for domain use cases such as
# AutoML Vision for image classification and object detection tasks and AutoML tables to
# deploy AI models on structured data.
#      Google Cloud AI services in Figure 2-4 include Cloud AutoML (train custom
# machine learning models leveraging transfer learning), Cloud Machine Learning Engine
# (for large-scale distributed training and deployment of machine learning models),
# Cloud TPU (to quickly train large-scale models), Video Intelligence (train custom video
# models), Cloud Natural Language API (extract/analyze text from documents), Cloud
# Speech API (transcribe audio to text), Cloud Vision API (classification/segmentation of
# images), Cloud Translate API (translate from one language to another), and Cloud Video
# Intelligence API (extract metadata from video files).

# 
#      This chapter provides a high-level overview of the products and services offered on
# Google Cloud Platform.
#      The next chapter will introduce the Google Cloud software development kit (SDK)
# for interacting with cloud resources from the command line on the local machine
# and the cloud command-line interface (CLI) for doing the same via the cloud console
# interface on GCP.
