An Overview of Google
Cloud Platform Services
Google Cloud Platform offers a wide range of services for securing, storing, serving,
and analyzing data. These cloud services form a secure cloud perimeter for data, where
different operations and transformations can be carried out on the data without it ever
leaving the cloud ecosystem.
     The services offered by Google Cloud include compute, storage, big data/analytics,
artificial intelligence (AI), and other networking, developer, and management services.
Let’s briefly review some of the features of the Google Cloud ecosystem.

 loud Compute
Google Compute offers a range of products shown in Figure 2-1 for catering to a wide
range of computational needs. The compute products consist of the Compute Engine
(virtual computing instances for custom processing), App Engine (a cloud-managed
platform for developing web, mobile, and IoT app), Kubernetes Engine (orchestration
manager for custom docker containers based on Kubernetes), Container Registry
(private container storage), Serverless Cloud Functions (cloud-based functions to
connect or extend cloud services), and Cloud Run (managed compute platform that
automatically scales your stateless containers).
