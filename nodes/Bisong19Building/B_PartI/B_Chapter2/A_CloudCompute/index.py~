# CHAPTER 2

# 
# 
# An Overview of Google
# Cloud Platform Services
# Google Cloud Platform offers a wide range of services for securing, storing, serving,
# and analyzing data. These cloud services form a secure cloud perimeter for data, where
# different operations and transformations can be carried out on the data without it ever
# leaving the cloud ecosystem.
#      The services offered by Google Cloud include compute, storage, big data/analytics,
# artificial intelligence (AI), and other networking, developer, and management services.
# Let’s briefly review some of the features of the Google Cloud ecosystem.
#

# C
#  loud Compute
# Google Compute offers a range of products shown in Figure 2-1 for catering to a wide
# range of computational needs. The compute products consist of the Compute Engine
# (virtual computing instances for custom processing), App Engine (a cloud-managed
# platform for developing web, mobile, and IoT app), Kubernetes Engine (orchestration
# manager for custom docker containers based on Kubernetes), Container Registry
# (private container storage), Serverless Cloud Functions (cloud-based functions to
# connect or extend cloud services), and Cloud Run (managed compute platform that
# automatically scales your stateless containers).

# Figure 2-1. Cloud compute services
# 
#    For our purposes of machine learning modeling, the cloud compute engine is what
# we will concentrate on. As later seen in Chapter 6, JupyterLab will provision a compute
# engine with all the relevant tools, packages, and frameworks for data analytics and
# modeling machine learning and deep learning solutions.
# 
# 
# 
# C
#  loud Storage
# Google Cloud Storage options provide scalable and real-time storage access to live and
# archival data within the cloud perimeter. Cloud storage as an example is set up to cater
# for any conceivable storage demand. Data stored on cloud storage is available anytime
# and from any location around the world. What’s more, this massive storage power comes
# at an almost negligible cost, taking into consideration the size and economic value of
# the stored data. Moreover, acknowledging the accessibility, security, and consistency
# provided by cloud storage, the cost is worth every penny.
#     The cloud storage products shown in Figure 2-2 include Cloud Storage (general-­
# purpose storage platform), Cloud SQL (cloud-managed MySQL and PostgreSQL), Cloud
# Bigtable (NoSQL petabyte-sized storage), Cloud Spanner (scalable/high availability
# transactional storage), Cloud Datastore (transactional NoSQL database), and Persistent
# Disk (block storage for virtual machines).
