# Regularization for Deep
# Learning
# Regularization is a technique for reducing the variance in the validation set, thus
# preventing the model from overfitting during training. In doing so, the model can better
# generalize to new examples. When training deep neural networks, a couple of strategies
# exist for use as a regularizer.

# Dropout is a regularization technique that prevents a deep neural network from
# overfitting by randomly discarding a number of neurons at every layer during training. In
# doing so, the neural network is not overly dominated by any one feature as it only makes
# use of a subset of neurons in each layer during training. In doing so, Dropout resembles
# an ensemble of neural networks as a similar but distinct neural network is trained at
# each layer. Dropout works by designating a probability that a neuron will be dropped in a
# layer. This probability value is called the Dropout rate. Figure 34-1 shows an example of a
# network with and without Dropout.
