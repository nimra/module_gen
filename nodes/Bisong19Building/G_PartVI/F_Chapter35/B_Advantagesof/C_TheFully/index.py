#      The essential advantage of the pooling layer is its ability to inject location invariance
# into the network. Location invariance means that features can be detected by the
# network no matter where they are on the image.
#      The pooling layer applies its aggregation function to all the channels of the input
# image. For example, in an R, G, B image (i.e., an image with three channels, red, green,
# and blue), the MaxPool will be applied independently to all the three channels. Similarly,
# for feature maps with a particular depth, the pooling aggregation will be applied
# separately to each feature map. See Figure 35-14 as an example of applying pooling to
# the channel depth of its inputs.

# The Fully Connected Network Layer
# The fully connected network (FCN) layer is our regular feedforward neural network
# or multilayer perceptron. These layers typically have a non-linear activation function.
# In any case, the FCN is the final layer of the convolutional neural network. In this
# case, a softmax activation is used to output the probabilities that an input belongs to a
# particular class.

# 
#     Before passing an input into the FCN, the image matrix will have to be flattened. For
# example, a 28 x 28 x 3 image matrix will become 2352 input weights plus a bias of 1 into
# the fully connected network.
#     In the case of our convolutional network, the feature maps of either the
# convolutional or pooling layer are flattened before passing into the FCN to compute the
# final network probabilities using the softmax function.

# An Example CNN Architecture
# We have discussed the building blocks of a convolutional neural network system. As
# youâ€™ve seen, a CNN system is principally composed of convolution layers, pooling layers,
# and the fully connected layer. However, the way these layers are arranged and in what
# number are down to the preferred heuristics of the particular use case that a CNN is
# employed in solving.
#    An example CNN modeling pipeline is shown here:
# 
#       1. The first layer following the input layer of images must be a
#          convolutional layer for extracting image features. A 3 x 3 image
#          filter is commonly used depending on the size of the input image.
# 
#       2. Pooling layers typical follow a set of one or more convolutional
#          layers. Typically, a 2 x 2 filter size is used in the pooling layer.
# 
#       3. The fully connected layer must be the final layer of the CNN. It
#          is also called the dense layer. It contains the softmax activation
#          function to give the probabilities of class membership.
# 
#       4. CNN may include one or more Dropout layers to prevent the
#          network from overfitting.
