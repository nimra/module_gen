# Chapter 1    What Is Cloud Computing?
# 
# 
# Categories of Cloud Solutions
# The cloud is a terminology that describes large sets of computers that are networked
# together in groups called data centers. These clustered machines can be interacted with
# via dashboards, command-line interfaces, REST APIs, and client libraries. Data centers
# are often distributed across multiple geographical locations. The size of data centers is
# over 100,000 sq. ft. (and those are the smaller sizes!). Cloud computing solutions can be
# broadly categorized into three, namely, the public, private, and hybrid cloud. Let’s briefly
# discuss them:
# 
#       •     Public cloud: Public clouds are the conventional cloud computing
#             model, where cloud service providers make available their
#             computing infrastructure and products for general use by other
#             enterprises and individuals (see Figure 1-1). In public clouds, the
#             cloud service provider is responsible for managing the hardware
#             configuration and servicing.

# 
#       •   Private cloud: In a private cloud, an organization is solely responsible
#           for the management and servicing of its computing infrastructure.
#           The machines in a private cloud can be located on-premises, or it
#           can be hosted with a cloud service provider but routed on a private
#           network.
# 
#       •   Hybrid cloud: The hybrid cloud is a compromise between the cost
#           and efficiency of a public cloud and the data sovereignty and in-­
#           house security assurances of the private cloud. Many companies
#           and institutions opt for a hybrid cloud and multi-cloud by using
#           technology solutions to facilitate easy porting and sharing of data and
#           applications between on-premise and cloud-based infrastructures.
# 
# 
# 
# Cloud Computing Models
# Cloud computing is also categorized into three models of service delivery. They are
# illustrated as a pyramid as shown in Figure 1-2, where the layers of infrastructure
# abstraction increase as we approach the apex of the pyramid:
# 
#       •   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This model is best suited for
#           enterprises or individuals who want to manage the hardware
#           infrastructure that hosts their data and applications. This level
#           of fine-grained management requires the necessary system
#           administration skills.
# 
#       •   Platform as a Service (PaaS): In the PaaS model, the hardware
#           configuration is managed by the cloud service provider, as well as
#           other system and development tools. This relieves the user to focus
#           on the business logic for quick and easy deployment of application
#           and database solutions. Another concept that comes up together
#           with PaaS is the idea of Serverless, where the cloud service provider
#           manages a scalable infrastructure that utilizes and relinquishes
#           resources according to demand.
# 
#       •   Software as a Service (SaaS): The SaaS model is most recognizable
#           by the general public, as a great deal of users interact with SaaS
#           applications without knowing. The typical examples of SaaS
# 
# 
#                                                                                          5
