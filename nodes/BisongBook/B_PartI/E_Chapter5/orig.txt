CHAPTER 5



Google Compute Engine
(GCE)
Google Compute Engine (GCE) makes available to users virtual machines (VMs) that are
running on Google’s data centers around the world. These machines take advantage of
Google’s state-of-the-art fiber optic powered network capabilities to offer fast and high-­
performance machines that can scale based on usage and automatically deal with issues
of load balancing.
     GCE provides a variety of pre-defined machine types for use out of the box; also it
has the option to create custom machines that are tailored to the specific needs of the
user. Another major feature of GCE is the ability to use computing resources that are
currently idle on Google infrastructure for a short period of time to enhance or speed up
the processing capabilities of batch jobs or fault-tolerant workloads. These machines are
called preemptible VMs and come at a huge cost-benefit to the user as they are about
80% cheaper than regular machines.
     Again one of the major benefits of GCEs is that the user only pays for the time
the machines are actually in operation. Also, when the machines are used for a long
uninterrupted period of time, discounts are accrued to the prices.
     In this chapter, we will go through a simple example of provisioning and tearing
down a Linux machine on the cloud. The examples will cover using the Google Cloud
web interface and the command-line interface for creating VMs on GCP.



Provisioning a VM Instance
To deploy a VM instance, click the triple dash in the top-left corner of the web page to
pull out the GCP resources drawer. In the group named ‘COMPUTE’, click the arrow
beside ‘Compute Engine’ and select ‘VM instances’ as shown in Figure 5-1.
