CHAPTER 4



Google Cloud Storage
(GCS)
Google Cloud Storage is a product for storing a wide range of diverse data objects.
Cloud storage may be used to store both live and archival data. It has guarantees of
scalability (can store increasingly large data objects), consistency (the most updated
version is served on request), durability (data is redundantly placed in separate
geographic locations to eliminate loss), and high availability (data is always available and
accessible).
    Let’s take a brief tour through creating and deleting a storage bucket, as well as
uploading and deleting files from a cloud storage bucket.

 reate a Bucket
A bucket, as the name implies, is a container for storing data objects on GCP. A bucket is
the base organizational structure on Cloud Storage. It is similar to the topmost directory
on a file system. Buckets may have a hierarchy of sub-folders containing data assets.
    To create a bucket,

       1. Click ‘Create bucket’ on the cloud storage dashboard as shown in
          Figure 4-1.

       2. Give the bucket a unique name (see Figure 4-2). Buckets in
          GCP must have a global unique name. That is to say, no two
          storage buckets on Google Cloud can have the same name. A
          common naming convention for buckets is to prefix with your
          organization’s domain name.
