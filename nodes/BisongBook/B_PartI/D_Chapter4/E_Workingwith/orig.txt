Chapter 4    Google Cloud Storage (GCS)


Working with GCS from the Command Line
In this section, we’ll carry out similar commands for creating and deleting buckets and
objects on GCS from the command-line interface.

      •     Creating a bucket: To create a bucket, execute the command

            gsutil mb gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

            As an example, we’ll create a bucket titled ‘hwosa_09_docs’.

            gsutil mb gs://hwosa_09_docs

            Creating gs://hwosa_09_docs/...

            List buckets on GCP project.

            gsutil ls

            gs://hwosa_09_docs/
            gs://my-first-bucket-ieee-carleton/

      •     Uploading objects to cloud bucket: To transfer objects from a local
            directory to the cloud bucket, execute the command

            gsutil cp -r [LOCAL_DIR] gs://[DESTINATION BUCKET]

            Copy an image file from the desktop to a bucket on GCP.

            gsutil cp -r /Users/ekababisong/Desktop/Howad.jpeg
            gs://hwosa_09_docs/

            Copying file:///Users/ekababisong/Desktop/Howad.jpeg
            [Content-Type=image/jpeg]...
            - [1 files][ 49.8 KiB/ 49.8 KiB]
            Operation completed over 1 objects/49.8 KiB.

            List objects in bucket.

            gsutil ls gs://hwosa_09_docs

            gs://hwosa_09_docs/Howad.jpeg

      •   Deleting objects from the cloud bucket: To delete a specific file from
          the bucket, execute

          gsutil rm -r gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET]/[FILE_NAME]

          To delete all files from the bucket, execute

          gsutil rm -a gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET]/**

          As an example, let’s delete the image file in the bucket ‘gs://hwosa_09_docs’.

          gsutil rm -r gs://hwosa_09_docs/Howad.jpeg

          Removing gs://hwosa_09_docs/Howad.jpeg#1537539161893501...
          / [1 objects]
          Operation completed over 1 objects.

      •   Deleting a bucket: When a bucket is deleted, all the files within that
          bucket are also deleted. This action is irreversible. To delete a bucket,
          execute the command

          gsutil rm -r gs://[SOURCE_BUCKET]/

          Delete the bucket ‘gs://hwosa_09_docs’

          gsutil rm -r gs://hwosa_09_docs/

          Removing gs://hwosa_09_docs/...

    This chapter works through uploading and deleting data from Google Cloud Storage
using the Cloud GUI console and command-line tools.
    In the next chapter, we will introduce Google Compute Engines, which are virtual
machines running on Google’s distributed data centers and are connected via state-of-­
the-art fiber optic network. These machines are provisioned to lower the cost and speed
up the processing of computing workloads.




                                                                                           33

Google Compute Engine
(GCE)
Google Compute Engine (GCE) makes available to users virtual machines (VMs) that are
running on Google’s data centers around the world. These machines take advantage of
Google’s state-of-the-art fiber optic powered network capabilities to offer fast and high-­
performance machines that can scale based on usage and automatically deal with issues
of load balancing.
     GCE provides a variety of pre-defined machine types for use out of the box; also it
has the option to create custom machines that are tailored to the specific needs of the
user. Another major feature of GCE is the ability to use computing resources that are
currently idle on Google infrastructure for a short period of time to enhance or speed up
the processing capabilities of batch jobs or fault-tolerant workloads. These machines are
called preemptible VMs and come at a huge cost-benefit to the user as they are about
80% cheaper than regular machines.
     Again one of the major benefits of GCEs is that the user only pays for the time
the machines are actually in operation. Also, when the machines are used for a long
uninterrupted period of time, discounts are accrued to the prices.
     In this chapter, we will go through a simple example of provisioning and tearing
down a Linux machine on the cloud. The examples will cover using the Google Cloud
web interface and the command-line interface for creating VMs on GCP.



Provisioning a VM Instance
To deploy a VM instance, click the triple dash in the top-left corner of the web page to
pull out the GCP resources drawer. In the group named ‘COMPUTE’, click the arrow
beside ‘Compute Engine’ and select ‘VM instances’ as shown in Figure 5-1.
