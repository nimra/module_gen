# Google Cloud Storage
# (GCS)
# Google Cloud Storage is a product for storing a wide range of diverse data objects.
# Cloud storage may be used to store both live and archival data. It has guarantees of
# scalability (can store increasingly large data objects), consistency (the most updated
# version is served on request), durability (data is redundantly placed in separate
# geographic locations to eliminate loss), and high availability (data is always available and
# accessible).
#     Let’s take a brief tour through creating and deleting a storage bucket, as well as
# uploading and deleting files from a cloud storage bucket.
# 
#

#  reate a Bucket
# A bucket, as the name implies, is a container for storing data objects on GCP. A bucket is
# the base organizational structure on Cloud Storage. It is similar to the topmost directory
# on a file system. Buckets may have a hierarchy of sub-folders containing data assets.
#     To create a bucket,
# 
#        1. Click ‘Create bucket’ on the cloud storage dashboard as shown in
#           Figure 4-1.
# 
#        2. Give the bucket a unique name (see Figure 4-2). Buckets in
#           GCP must have a global unique name. That is to say, no two
#           storage buckets on Google Cloud can have the same name. A
#           common naming convention for buckets is to prefix with your
#           organization’s domain name.
