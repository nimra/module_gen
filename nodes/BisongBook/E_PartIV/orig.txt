Introduction to
Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a Python library that provides a standard interface for implementing
machine learning algorithms. It includes other ancillary functions that are integral
to the machine learning pipeline such as data preprocessing steps, data resampling
techniques, evaluation parameters, and search interfaces for tuning/optimizing an
algorithm’s performance.
    This section will go through the functions for implementing a typical machine
learning pipeline with Scikit-learn. Since, Scikit-learn has a variety of packages and
modules that are called depending on the use case, we’ll import a module directly from
a package if and when needed using the from keyword. Again the goal of this material is
to provide the foundation to be able to comb through the exhaustive Scikit-learn library
and be able to use the right tool or function to get the job done.



Loading Sample Datasets from Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn comes with a set of small standard datasets for quickly testing and
prototyping machine learning models. These datasets are ideal for learning purposes
when starting off working with machine learning or even trying out the performance of
some new model. They save a bit of the time required to identify, download, and clean
up a dataset obtained from the wild. However, these datasets are small and well curated,
they do not represent real-world scenarios.
    Five popular sample datasets are
       •    Boston house-prices dataset

       •    Diabetes dataset

                                                                                          215
