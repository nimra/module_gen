# Considerations for Selecting K
# Thereâ€™s really no way of telling the number of clusters in a dataset from the onset. The
# best way of selecting k is to try out different values of K to see what works best in creating
# distinct clusters.
#      Another strategy, which is widely employed in practice, is to compute the average
# distance of the points in the cluster to the cluster centroid for all clusters. This estimate
# is plotted on a graph as we progressively increase the value of K. We observe that as K
# increases, the distance of points from the centroid of its cluster gradually reduces, and
# the generated curve resembles the elbow of an arm. From practice, we choose the value
# of K just after the elbow as the best K value for that dataset. This method is called the
# elbow method for selecting K as is illustrated in Figure 25-3.
