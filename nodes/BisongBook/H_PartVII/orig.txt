Google BigQuery
BigQuery is a Google-managed data warehouse product that is highly scalable, fast, and
optimized for data analytics with rudimentary in-built machine learning capabilities
as part of the product offering. It is also one of Google’s many serverless products. This
means that you do not physically manage the infrastructure assets and the overhead
responsibilities/costs. It is only used to solve the business use case, and it just works in a
highly performant manner.
     BigQuery is suited for storing and analyzing structured data. The idea of structured
data is that it must have a schema that describes the columns or fields of the dataset. CSV
or JSON files are examples of structured data formats. BigQuery differentiates itself from
other relational databases in that it can store a collection of other fields (or columns) as a
record type, and a particular field in a row can have more than one value. These features
make BigQuery more expressive for storing datasets without the flat row constraint of
relational databases.
     Similar to relational databases, BigQuery organizes rows into tables, and are
accessed using the familiar Structured Query Language (SQL) for databases. However,
individual rows in a table cannot be updated by running a SQL Update statement. Tables
can only be appended to or entirely re-written. Meanwhile, a group of tables in BigQuery
is organized into datasets.
     When a query is executed in BigQuery, it runs in parallel on thousands of cores.
This feature greatly accelerates the performance of query execution and consequently
the speed of gaining insights from your data. This ability for massive parallel execution
is one of the major reasons individuals, companies, and institutions are migrating to
BigQuery as their data warehouse of choice.
     Also BigQueryML is a powerful platform for building machine learning models
inside of BigQuery. The models take advantage of automated feature engineering and
hyper-parameter optimization and are automatically updated based on changes to
the underlying dataset. This feature is extremely powerful and lowers the threshold
