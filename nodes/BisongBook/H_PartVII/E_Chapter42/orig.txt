CHAPTER 42



Google AutoML:
Cloud Vision
Google Cloud AutoML Vision facilitates the creation of custom vision models for image
recognition use cases. This managed service works with the concepts of transfer learning
and neural architecture search under the hood to find the best network architecture
and the optimal hyper-parameter configuration of that architecture that minimizes the
loss function of the model. This chapter will go through a sample project of building a
custom image recognition model using Google Cloud AutoML Vision. In this chapter, we
will build an image model to recognize select cereal boxes.



Enable AutoML Cloud Vision on GCP
Step through the following steps to enable AutoML Cloud Vision on GCP:

       1. Open Cloud Vision by clicking the triple dash at the top-left corner
          of the GCP dashboard. Select Vision under the product section
          ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE as shown in Figure 42-1.
