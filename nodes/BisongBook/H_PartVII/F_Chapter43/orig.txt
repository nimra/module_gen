CHAPTER 43



Google AutoML: Cloud
Natural Language
Processing
This chapter will build a language toxicity classification model to classify and recognize
toxic and non-toxic or clean phrases using Google Cloud AutoML for natural language
processing (NLP). The data used in this project is from the Toxic Comment Classification
Challenge on Kaggle by Jigsaw and Google. The data is modified to have a sample of
16,000 toxic and 16,000 non-toxic words as inputs to build the model on AutoML NLP.



Enable AutoML NLP on GCP
The following steps will enable AutoML NLP on GCP:

       1. Click the triple dash in the top-left corner of the interface and
          select Natural Language under the category ARTIFICIAL
          INTELLIGENCE as shown in Figure 43-1.
