#  roadcasting
# NumPy has an elegant mechanism for arithmetic operation on arrays with different
# dimensions or shapes. As an example, when a scalar is added to a vector (or 1-D array).
# The scalar value is conceptually broadcasted or stretched across the rows of the array
# and added element-wise. See Figure 10-5.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Figure 10-5. Broadcasting example of adding a scalar to a vector (or 1-D array)
# 
#     Matrices with different shapes can be broadcasted to perform arithmetic operations
# by stretching the dimension of the smaller array. Broadcasting is another vectorized
# operation for speeding up matrix processing. However, not all arrays with different
# shapes can be broadcasted. For broadcasting to occur, the trailing axes for the arrays
# must be the same size or 1.
#     In the example that follows, the matrices A and B have the same rows, but the
# column of matrix B is 1. Hence, an arithmetic operation can be performed on them by
# broadcasting and adding the cells element-wise.
# 
# A      (2d array):  4 x 3       + <perform addition>
# B      (2d array):  4 x 1
# Result (2d array):  4 x 3
# 
#       See Figure 10-6 for more illustration.

# Figure 10-6. Matrix broadcasting example
# 
#    Let’s see this in code:
# 
# # create a 4 X 3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 10
# A = np.random.randint(1, 10, [4, 3])
# A
# 'Output':
# array([[9, 9, 5],
#        [8, 2, 8],
#        [6, 3, 1],
#        [5, 1, 4]])
# 
# 
# 
#                                                                             111
# 
# Chapter 10    NumPy
# 
# # create a 4 X 1 matrix of random integers between 1 and 10
# B = np.random.randint(1, 10, [4, 1])
# B
# 'Output':
# array([[1],
#        [3],
#        [9],
#        [8]])
# # add A and B
# A + B
# 'Output':
# array([[10, 10,  6],
#        [11,  5, 11],
#        [15, 12, 10],
#        [13,  9, 12]])
# 
#    The example that follows cannot be broadcasted and will result in a ValueError:
# operands could not be broadcasted together with shapes (4,3) (4,2) because the matrices
# A and B have different columns and do not fit with the aforementioned rules of
# broadcasting that the trailing axes for the arrays must be the same size or 1.
# 
# A      (2d array):  4 x 3
# B      (2d array):  4 x 2
# The dimensions do not match - they must be either the same or 1
# 
#       When we try to add the preceding example in Python, we get an error.
# 
# A = np.random.randint(1, 10, [4, 3])
# B = np.random.randint(1, 10, [4, 2])
# A + B
# 'Output':
# Traceback (most recent call last):
# 
#   File "<ipython-input-145-624e41e41a31>", line 1, in <module>
#     A + B
#

# Loading Data
# Loading data is an important process in the data analysis/machine learning pipeline.
# Data usually comes in .csv format. csv files can be loaded into Python by using the
# loadtxt method. The parameter skiprows skips the first row of the dataset – it is usually
# the header row of the data.
# 
# np.loadtxt(open("the_file_name.csv", "rb"), delimiter=",", skiprows=1)
# 
#    Pandas is a preferred package for loading data in Python.
#    We will learn more about Pandas for data manipulation in the next chapter.
