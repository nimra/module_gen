else:
    print('The number is negative and not an integer')

'Output': Number is an integer


The while Loop
The while loop evaluates a condition, which, if true, repeatedly executes the set of
instructions within the while block. It does so until the condition evaluates to false. The
while statement is visualized by the flowchart in Figure 9-3.




Figure 9-3. Flowchart of the while loop

     Here is a program example:

a = 8
while a > 0:
    print('Number is', a)

    # decrement a
    a -= 1




82

'Output': Number is 8
     Number is 7
     Number is 6
     Number is 5
     Number is 4
     Number is 3
     Number is 2
     Number is 1


T he for Loop
The for loop repeats the statements within its code block until a terminating condition
is reached. It is different from the while loop in that it knows exactly how many times
the iteration should occur. The for loop is controlled by an iterable expression (i.e.,
expressions in which elements can be accessed sequentially). The for statement is
visualized by the flowchart in Figure 9-4.
