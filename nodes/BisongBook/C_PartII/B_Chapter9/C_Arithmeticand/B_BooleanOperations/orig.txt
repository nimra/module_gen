Arithmetic and Boolean Operations
This section introduces operators for programming arithmetic and logical constructs.


Arithmetic Operations
In Python, we can operate on data using familiar algebra operations such as addition +,
subtraction -, multiplication *, division /, and exponentiation **.

2 + 2     # addition
'Output': 4
5 - 3     # subtraction
'Output': 2
4 * 4     # multiplication
'Output': 16
10 / 2    # division
'Output': 5.0
2**4 / (5 + 3)    # use brackets to enforce precedence
'Output': 2.0


Boolean Operations
Boolean operations evaluate to True or False. Boolean operators include the comparison
and logical operators. The comparison operators include less than or equal to <=, less
than <, greater than or equal to >=, greater than >, not equal to !=, and equal to ==.

2 < 5
'Output': True
2 <= 5
'Output': True

2 > 5
'Output':   False
2 >= 5
'Output':   False
2 != 5
'Output':   True
2 == 5
'Output':   False

   The logical operators include Boolean NOT (not), Boolean AND (and), and Boolean
OR (or). We can also carry out identity and membership tests using

      •   is, is not (identity)

      •   in, not in (membership)

a = [1, 2, 3]
2 in a
'Output': True
2 not in a
'Output': False
2 is a
'Output': False
2 is not a
'Output': True



The print() Statement
The print() statement is a simple way to show the output of data values to the console.
Variables can be concatenated using the comma. Space is implicitly added after the
comma.

a = 'I'
b = 'Love'
c = 'You'
print(a, b, c)
'Output': I Love You
