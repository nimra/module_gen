# Matplotlib and Seaborn
# It is critical to be able to plot the observations and variables of a dataset before subjecting
# the dataset to some machine learning algorithm or another. Data visualization is
# essential to understand your data and to glean insights into the underlying structure of
# the dataset. These insights help the scientist in deciding with statistical analysis or which
# learning algorithm is more appropriate for the given dataset. Also, the scientist can get
# ideas on suitable transformations to apply to the dataset.
#       In general, visualization in data science can conveniently be split into univariate
# and multivariate data visualizations. Univariate data visualization involves plotting
# a single variable to understand more about its distribution and structure, while
# multivariate plots expose the relationship and structure between two or more variables.

#  atplotlib and Seaborn
# Matplotlib is a graphics package for data visualization in Python. Matplotlib has arisen
# as a key component in the Python data science stack and is well integrated with NumPy
# and Pandas. The pyplot module mirrors the MATLAB plotting commands closely.
# Hence, MATLAB users can easily transit to plotting with Python.
#     Seaborn, on the other hand, extends the Matplotlib library for creating beautiful
# graphics with Python using a more straightforward set of methods. Seaborn is more
# integrated for working with Pandas DataFrames. We will go through creating simple
# essential plots with Matplotlib and seaborn.
# 
# 
# Pandas Plotting Methods
# Pandas also has a robust set of plotting functions which we will also use for visualizing
# our dataset. The reader will observe how we can easily convert datasets from NumPy to
# Pandas and vice versa to take advantage of one functionality or the other. The plotting
# features of Pandas are found in the plotting module.
