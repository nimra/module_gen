Virtual Machines vs. Containers
Virtual machines (VMs), illustrated in Figure 45-3, emulate the capabilities of a physical
machine making it possible to install and run operating systems by using a hypervisor.
The hypervisor is a piece of software on the physical machine (the host) that makes it
possible to carry out virtualization where multiple guest machines are managed by the
host machine.

    Containers on the other hand isolate the environment for hosting an application
with its own libraries and software dependencies; however, as opposed to a VM,
containers on a machine all share the same operating system kernel. Docker is an
example of a container. This is illustrated in Figure 45-4.

 orking with Docker
Google Cloud Shell comes pre-configured with Docker.
   Key concepts to note are

      •   Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that specifies how an image will
          be created.

      •   Docker images: Images are created by building a Dockerfile.

      •   Docker containers: Docker containers are the running instance of an
          image.
   The diagram in Figure 45-5 highlights the process to build an image and run a
Docker container.
