                                     Chapter 45   Containers and Google Kubernetes Engine

F eatures of Kubernetes
The following are some features of Kubernetes:

      •   Horizontal auto-scaling: Dynamically scales containers based on
          resource demands

      •   Self-healing: Re-provisions failed nodes in response to health checks

      •   Load balancing: Efficiently distributes requests between containers
          in a pod

      •   Rollbacks and updates: Easily update or revert to a previous
          container deployment without causing application downtime

      •   DNS service discovery: Uses Domain Name System (DNS) to manage
          container groups as a Kubernetes service


C
 omponents of Kubernetes
The main components of the Kubernetes engine are

      •   Master node(s): Manages the Kubernetes cluster. There may be more
          than one master node in high availability mode for fault-tolerance
          purposes. In this case, only one is the master, and the others follow.

      •   Worker node(s): Machine(s) that runs containerized applications that
          are scheduled as pod(s).

   The illustration in Figure 45-6 provides an overview of the Kubernetes architecture.
