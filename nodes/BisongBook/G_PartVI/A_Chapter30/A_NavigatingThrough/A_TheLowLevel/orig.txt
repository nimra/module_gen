The Low-Level TensorFlow APIs
The low-level API gives the tools for building network graphs from the ground up using
mathematical operations. This API level affords the greatest level of flexibility to tweak
and tune the model as desired. Moreover, the higher-level APIs implement low-level
operations under the hood.


The Mid-Level TensorFlow APIs
TensorFlow provides a set of reusable packages for simplifying the process involved in
creating neural network models. Some examples of these functions include the layers
(tf.keras.layers), Datasets (tf.data), metrics (tf.keras.metrics), loss (tf.keras.losses),
and FeatureColumns (tf.feature_column) packages.

L ayers
The layers package (tf.keras.layers) provides a handy set of functions to simplify the
construction of layers in a neural network architecture. For example, consider the
convolutional network architecture in Figure 30-2 and how the layers API simplifies the
creation of the network layers.
