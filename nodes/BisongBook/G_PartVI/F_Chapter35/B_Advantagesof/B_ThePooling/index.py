# The Pooling Layer
# Pooling layers typically follow one or more convolutional layers. The goal of the pooling
# layer is to reduce or downsample the feature map of the convolutional layer. The pooling
# layer summarizes the image features learned in the previous network layers. By doing so,
# it also helps prevent the network from overfitting. Moreso, the reduction in the input size
# also bodes well for processing and memory costs when training the network.
#      The pooling layer can be seen as an aggregation function that consolidates learned
# features and extracts the essential features from previous layers. It does not conduct any
# multiplicative transformation on the input feature maps as seen in the convolutional layer.
#      The aggregation functions carried out by the pooling layer include max, sum, and
# average. The most frequently used aggregation function in practice is the max and is
# commonly called the MaxPool.
#      The aggregation functions of the pooling layer serve as the layersâ€™ filters. Just like
# the filters of the convolutional layer, they have a receptive field (although smaller in size
# than that of the convolutional layer) and a stride width. Howbeit, the filters which are the
# neurons of the pooling layer have no weight or biases. A typical size for the pooling filter
# is a 2 x 2 matrix as shown in Figure 35-13.

#      The essential advantage of the pooling layer is its ability to inject location invariance
# into the network. Location invariance means that features can be detected by the
# network no matter where they are on the image.
#      The pooling layer applies its aggregation function to all the channels of the input
# image. For example, in an R, G, B image (i.e., an image with three channels, red, green,
# and blue), the MaxPool will be applied independently to all the three channels. Similarly,
# for feature maps with a particular depth, the pooling aggregation will be applied
# separately to each feature map. See Figure 35-14 as an example of applying pooling to
# the channel depth of its inputs.

# The Fully Connected Network Layer
# The fully connected network (FCN) layer is our regular feedforward neural network
# or multilayer perceptron. These layers typically have a non-linear activation function.
# In any case, the FCN is the final layer of the convolutional neural network. In this
# case, a softmax activation is used to output the probabilities that an input belongs to a
# particular class.
