   Unsupervised Learning and Preprocessing




The second family of machine learning algorithms that we will discuss is unsuper‐
vised learning algorithms. Unsupervised learning subsumes all kinds of machine
learning where there is no known output, no teacher to instruct the learning algo‐
rithm. In unsupervised learning, the learning algorithm is just shown the input data
and asked to extract knowledge from this data.

Types of Unsupervised Learning
We will look into two kinds of unsupervised learning in this chapter: transformations
of the dataset and clustering.
Unsupervised transformations of a dataset are algorithms that create a new representa‐
tion of the data which might be easier for humans or other machine learning algo‐
rithms to understand compared to the original representation of the data. A common
application of unsupervised transformations is dimensionality reduction, which takes
a high-dimensional representation of the data, consisting of many features, and finds
a new way to represent this data that summarizes the essential characteristics with
fewer features. A common application for dimensionality reduction is reduction to
two dimensions for visualization purposes.
Another application for unsupervised transformations is finding the parts or compo‐
nents that “make up” the data. An example of this is topic extraction on collections of
text documents. Here, the task is to find the unknown topics that are talked about in
each document, and to learn what topics appear in each document. This can be useful
for tracking the discussion of themes like elections, gun control, or pop stars on social
media.
Clustering algorithms, on the other hand, partition data into distinct groups of similar
items. Consider the example of uploading photos to a social media site. To allow you
