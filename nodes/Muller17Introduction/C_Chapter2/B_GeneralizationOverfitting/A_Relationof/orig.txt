Relation of Model Complexity to Dataset Size
It’s important to note that model complexity is intimately tied to the variation of
inputs contained in your training dataset: the larger variety of data points your data‐
set contains, the more complex a model you can use without overfitting. Usually, col‐
lecting more data points will yield more variety, so larger datasets allow building
more complex models. However, simply duplicating the same data points or collect‐
ing very similar data will not help.
Going back to the boat selling example, if we saw 10,000 more rows of customer data,
and all of them complied with the rule “If the customer is older than 45, and has less
than 3 children or is not divorced, then they want to buy a boat,” we would be much
more likely to believe this to be a good rule than when it was developed using only
the 12 rows in Table 2-1.
Having more data and building appropriately more complex models can often work
wonders for supervised learning tasks. In this book, we will focus on working with
datasets of fixed sizes. In the real world, you often have the ability to decide how
much data to collect, which might be more beneficial than tweaking and tuning your
model. Never underestimate the power of more data.

Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms
We will now review the most popular machine learning algorithms and explain how
they learn from data and how they make predictions. We will also discuss how the
concept of model complexity plays out for each of these models, and provide an over‐
